&lt;p&gt;6 am My alarm goes off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:10 am my alarm goes off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:20 am my alarm goes off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:30 am my alarm goes off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-8 am I try and survive the morning cat feed, preparing my lunch, getting breakfast. And make a half hearted attempt to be ready and at work for 8 am&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:10 am arrive at work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:10 am-4:30 pm spend the day in my own pit of hell having to work with some of the dumbest people I have ever had the misfortune of meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:30-8:30 pm This could go either way. Depending on the kind of day Zara has had will dictate everything, from the mood of the cats to affecting every ounce of my being. Watch tv, eat dinner, feed cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:30-10 pm This will be stressful regardless. Getting cats sorted, fed, and happy whilst we bicker about everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10-12pm Bed. Peace. Quiet. The time I can do what I want, watch what I want. The world has gone to sleep. The world is silent. I should be going to sleep. Getting rest to repeat the whole process all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel my time is wasted being asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do sometimes enjoy it. When it’s going slow, at the bottom where it feels like it’s virtually stopped. The calm before the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

Here I go. A blog about my thoughts and ideas. I don’t have many thoughts. Or ideas. I feel like I just float through life being buffeted by whatever comes my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember being asked by the careers counselor at school what I wanted to be in life. I didn’t have a clue. I was a suicidal 15 year old so I just said I wanted to be happy. I was asked again when I was at college.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; now a suicidal 17 year old. I still didn’t know. I didn’t know at 20, 30 or 40. I’m now 51 and I still don’t know. Nor do I care now. I’ve sailed through life without any goal or vision. I’ve seen people i love die before their time. I’ve seen relationships crumble and dreams shatter. So I just keep floating through life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/paddysplace/image/upload/v1625159510/blog/undraw_career_progress_ivdb_vk9nxw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Career progress&quot; /&gt;I’ve made half hearted attempts at life. I’ve had moments where things seemed to be going well_._ But they fade away eventually. I’ve been good, bad, selfish, selfless and on occasions illegal. But nothing seems to stick. I’ve thrown myself into interests 110% but eventually the bubble bursts and I’m looking for the next hook. The next thing I can cling onto in the hope it can catapult me through the rest of my life. It’s a lot to ask of something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all sounds so pointless as a life. We’ve only got one life so live it. So they say. But it’s like being given a book and told to read it. And enjoy it. It’s the only book you’re ever going to have. So make the most of it. So you slog your way through page after page of mundane story. Just hoping you can get through it quickly. To get to the end and breathe your last sigh of relief that it’s finally over.&lt;/p&gt;
