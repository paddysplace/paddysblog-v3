Laid in way too long on Saturday and rushed around like a mad thing trying to put a suit on and tie a bloody tie properly! And yes, you read that right...I wore a suit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wedding went really well. As in, ate loads of food and got pissed. Ended up videoing the wedding itself which was pretty cool. Wasnt a big do, we left at about 10pm and went to the pub. So the night ended just before midnight after drinking vodka, bitter, wine, champagne and more vodka…not all in the same glass tho!Went for a meal with my girlfriend, her sis and husband at their dad and his girlfriend`s house today. Got loads of computer bits n stuff to sell on ebay so ended coming home with more things than we came with. Survived the weekend quite well considering me and my girlfriend slept in a single bed and managed to avoid any embarrassing moments meeting her sis on the way to the toilet!So gonna soak in the bath cos I ache like mad, then rip an old pc apart to see what I can scrounge out of it. Need another weekend to recover from this one.\n",

Something weve never had to, but I just worry cos I know well be screwed if it came to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worry about our new car. Even tho if wed stayed as we were with seperate cars wed  be paying out a lot more than we are doing now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worry about our house, cos im not diy minded in the slightest! And im such a lazy sod and would prefer to just sit at my computer and take a break from the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worry about my girlfriend.

Its difficult to tell how itll pan out until the end of the year. But it looks like were using more than were paying for. Im sure theres ways to cut down. We have a lot of computer stuff running, some of it 24/7. Gonna find a way to cut back on the things that dont need to be left on permanently and see if it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im just a worryhead really.

If theres one album that sums up my youth then its Pink Floyds 'The Wall'. Hands down the best album ever. Got round to buying it on cd after losing my cassette version a while ago. With the one song thats brought me to tears so many times, Comfortably Numb, I can listen to all 26 tracks now without wanting to self harm.

I ended up having to kill it as quickly as I could. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just fucks me off when people do such pointless things. Kicking a wasp to death or kicking a puppy to death, I personally do not differentiate between animals. Then!..then!..the guy said 'aww, I feel kinda sorry for it now'.

The doctor tells them that they’re physically okay, but they might want to start writing things down to help them remember.Later that night while watching TV, the old man gets up from his chair.His wife asks, “Where are you going?”“To the kitchen” he replies.“Will you get me a bowl of ice cream?”“Sure.”“Don’t you think you should write it down so you can remember it?” she asks.“No, I can remember it.”“Well, I’d like some strawberries on top, too. You’d better write it down because you know you’ll forget it.”He says , “I!  can remember that!  You want a bowl of ice cream with strawberries.”“I’d also like whipped cream.  I’m certain you’ll forget that, so you’d better write it down!” she retorts.Irritated, he says, “I don’t need to write it down, I can remember it! Leave me alone!  Ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream - I got it, for goodness sake!”Then he grumbles into the kitchen.After about 20 minutes the old man returns from the kitchen and hands his wife a plate of bacon and eggs.She stares at the plate for a moment and says - “Where’s my toast?\n",

        "excerpt": "Well its getting late and im tired so I wasnt going to post anything tonight until Zara said 'you havent written anything’…‘youve been in the bath'...'you always write something when youre in the bath’.So here it is.My post bath post, heh.I guess all I can say is bathrooms! im sick of seeing bathrooms. Talking bathrooms. Bathroom wallpaper, bathroom tiles, bathroom flooring, bathroom accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, we have started the redecorating, redesigning and anything else beginning in 're' of the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent most of yesterday with girlfriend and mother going round Ikea. My mum has never been before so it was like taking a kiddie round a toy store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So did we buy anything? yes...a shower curtain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least it was a cheap(ish) shopping trip. Went with a list of about 30 things and ended up buying about 3. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today was spent going round diy stores picking out tiles and flooring and wallpaper. Decisions were made, choices were chosen. And after yo-yoing between B&amp;Q, Homebase and Focus we found the optimum combination of tile, wallpaper and floor tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ive been ripping old tiles off the wall, which is great for stress relief. And as all DIY projects go it all ended in a falling out between me and Zara.But all is well again in Paddy Towers. One wall is tile free, I even cleaned up after my destruction.

        "content": "Well its getting late and im tired so I wasnt going to post anything tonight until Zara said 'you havent written anything’…‘youve been in the bath'...'you always write something when youre in the bath’.So here it is.My post bath post, heh.I guess all I can say is bathrooms! im sick of seeing bathrooms. Talking bathrooms. Bathroom wallpaper, bathroom tiles, bathroom flooring, bathroom accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, we have started the redecorating, redesigning and anything else beginning in 're' of the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent most of yesterday with girlfriend and mother going round Ikea. My mum has never been before so it was like taking a kiddie round a toy store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So did we buy anything? yes...a shower curtain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least it was a cheap(ish) shopping trip. Went with a list of about 30 things and ended up buying about 3. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today was spent going round diy stores picking out tiles and flooring and wallpaper. Decisions were made, choices were chosen. And after yo-yoing between B&amp;Q, Homebase and Focus we found the optimum combination of tile, wallpaper and floor tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ive been ripping old tiles off the wall, which is great for stress relief. And as all DIY projects go it all ended in a falling out between me and Zara.But all is well again in Paddy Towers. One wall is tile free, I even cleaned up after my destruction. So now all I have to do is go through that another 3 times before we can start taking out the old bath, sink and toilet. Assuming the new suite gets delivered!I`m going to work tomorrow for a rest!\n",

Even here on my own blog so Ill not. So some of this might sound a bit obscure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We only met him once. &lt;br /&gt;At a party. Last year.&lt;br /&gt;A bbq. We met a lot of family neither of us had met before.&lt;br /&gt;We met her brother.&lt;br /&gt;He seemed like a nice bloke.&lt;br /&gt;He was a nice bloke, they were close.&lt;br /&gt;But he suffered from depression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And today we learnt hed commited suicide.Id only met him briefly at the party but it hit me really bad. I dont know if it was because it reminded me of how I felt when I heard my brother had been killed on his motorbike. Or the depression. Or the suicide.I was 16 the first time. I didnt know where my life was going, who I was or why I was on this planet. A typical teenager I guess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to cut. If I felt low or unwanted I would take a razor blade to my arm and make quick cuts across my arms and wrists. Wasnt like I was trying to kill myself, just hurt myself. Just a little.I was 16 and a friends party. She was more than a friend. Well to me she was. We were close. But not in the way I wanted to be. I wanted more than friendship. And she knew this. Our other friends said she used to lead me on a bit. But she didnt she it. Anyway, at this party. I felt that was the night we might get to be more than friends. I dont know why. Im a 16 yr old boy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we down drinks all night and shes going round all her friends and sitting with us and laughing. And then her boyfriend comes in. Urgh. I didnt even know. I felt like id been punched in the chest. I had to get out.A mate agreed to take me home cos I was drunk and upset and banging my head against the toilet wall. I hate myself for ruining his night.We went back to his flat. I felt numb. Part drink, part emotion. I went to the toilet . I saw the razor blade. I dont really remember much after that except my mate screaming down the phone for an ambulance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recovered. Got over her. Eventually and managed to go on with life without a dark shadow hanging over me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I was 30 and I met C. My life wasnt too good. My wife and I werent exactly the closest couple. My brother had been killed by this time and my wifes dad was dying from cancer.We met up, things happened things went wrong. All this over the course of a few months. My wifes dad died. The old feelings of being helpless came back. I was 16 again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat at my computer and thought I couldnt keep going on like this. I took a plastic bag, put it over my head and tied it tight around my neck and waited for the oxygen to run out.I was hyperventilating when my mobile rang and it was C on the phone. I ripped the bag off in a panic. Running out of air is a horrible feeling. Your body starts panicing and you breath faster and faster to try and get what little air there is left into your lungs.Maybe I wasnt serious about going through with it. But why did C ring up like that. It wasnt planned. It was out the blue.But I can understand how he could have killed himself. For me it was love. Always is. For others its money. Or feeling a failure. Or losing your job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often wonder how far I would have gone if it hadnt been for that phone call.A lot went on in those months to get me to that point. And I vowed never to get there again. I hope I can see the signs. Me and the wife split up. Wes mentally seperated a long time ago really. She was always with her mum after her dad died. Which I understood. But she didnt need me.I felt guilty for all this happening whilst she dealt with her dad. But I was still grieving over my brother. The blinkers were on. I could only see the dark tunnel I was in.There`s no accounting for timing I guess.\n",

Eventually and managed to go on with life without a dark shadow hanging over me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I was 30 and I met C. My life wasnt too good. My wife and I werent exactly the closest couple. My brother had been killed by this time and my wifes dad was dying from cancer.We met up, things happened things went wrong. All this over the course of a few months. My wifes dad died. The old feelings of being helpless came back. I was 16 again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat at my computer and thought I couldnt keep going on like this. I took a plastic bag, put it over my head and tied it tight around my neck and waited for the oxygen to run out.I was hyperventilating when my mobile rang and it was C on the phone. I ripped the bag off in a panic. Running out of air is a horrible feeling. Your body starts panicing and you breath faster and faster to try and get what little air there is left into your lungs.Maybe I wasnt serious about going through with it. But why did C ring up like that. It wasnt planned. It was out the blue.But I can understand how he could have killed himself. For me it was love. Always is. For others its money. Or feeling a failure. Or losing your job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often wonder how far I would have gone if it hadnt been for that phone call.A lot went on in those months to get me to that point. And I vowed never to get there again. I hope I can see the signs. Me and the wife split up. Wes mentally seperated a long time ago really. She was always with her mum after her dad died. Which I understood. But she didnt need me.I felt guilty for all this happening whilst she dealt with her dad. But I was still grieving over my brother. The blinkers were on. I could only see the dark tunnel I was in.There`s no accounting for timing I guess.\n",

I think its because I really couldnt think of the words to describe his blog. No words could do it justice. All I can say is go…go now, and let the experience that is The Haunted House Dressing wash over you.And finally…the bathroom. Well, its getting there. Ive been trying to stay out the way and only help when its been asked for. Otherwise wed probably be knee deep in water by now. Its looking good.

That can’t be, I have so much to live for, I haven’t said goodbye to my family….. you’ve got to send me backstraight away”.St Peter replied: “Yes you can be reincarnated but there is a catch. We can only send you back as a dog or a hen.”Brian was devastated, but knowing there was a farm not far from his house, he asked to be sent back as a hen.A flash of light later he was covered in feathers and clucking around pecking the ground.“This ain’t so bad” he thought until he felt this strange feeling welling up inside him.The farmyard rooster strolled over and said:“So you’re the new hen, how are you enjoying your first day here?”“It’s not so bad” replies Brian, “but I have this strange feeling Inside like I’m about to explode”.“You’re ovulating” explained the rooster, “don’t tell me you’ve never laid an egg before”.“Never” replies Brian“Well just relax and let it happen”And so he did and after a few uncomfortable seconds later, an egg pops out from under his tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him and his emotions got the better of him as he experienced motherhood for the first time.When he laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming, and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that ever happened to him… ever!!!The joy kept coming and as he was just about to lay his third egg he felt an enormous smack on the back of his head and heard his wife shouting:“Brian, wake up you drunken bstard, you’re shtting in the bed”\n",

We can only send you back as a dog or a hen.”Brian was devastated, but knowing there was a farm not far from his house, he asked to be sent back as a hen.A flash of light later he was covered in feathers and clucking around pecking the ground.“This ain’t so bad” he thought until he felt this strange feeling welling up inside him.The farmyard rooster strolled over and said:“So you’re the new hen, how are you enjoying your first day here?”“It’s not so bad” replies Brian, “but I have this strange feeling Inside like I’m about to explode”.“You’re ovulating” explained the rooster, “don’t tell me you’ve never laid an egg before”.“Never” replies Brian“Well just relax and let it happen”And so he did and after a few uncomfortable seconds later, an egg pops out from under his tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him and his emotions got the better of him as he experienced motherhood for the first time.When he laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming, and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that ever happened to him… ever!!!The joy kept coming and as he was just about to lay his third egg he felt an enormous smack on the back of his head and heard his wife shouting:“Brian, wake up you drunken bstard, you’re shtting in the bed”\n",

Oh God, I hope that doesnt start filling her with regret!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes miss being on my own. But thats because im quite a solitary person to begin with.

You don’t hear us complaining about you leaving it down.Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not considered by us to be opportunities to see if we can find the perfect present . . . . again!Sometimes we are not thinking about you. Live with it.Sunday = sports. It’s like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.Don’t cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair, and by then you’re stuck with her.Ask for what you want. Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!We don’t remember dates. . . .Period!!Most guys own three pairs of shoes - tops. What makes you think we’d be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That’s what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.If you won’t dress like the Victoria’s Secret girls, don’t expect us to act like soap opera guys.If you think you’re fat, you probably are. Don’t ask us. We’ve been tricked before!!If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway; it’s genetic.You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out.

You don’t hear us complaining about you leaving it down.Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not considered by us to be opportunities to see if we can find the perfect present . . . . again!Sometimes we are not thinking about you. Live with it.Sunday = sports. It’s like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.Don’t cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair, and by then you’re stuck with her.Ask for what you want. Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!We don’t remember dates. . . .Period!!Most guys own three pairs of shoes - tops. What makes you think we’d be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That’s what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.If you won’t dress like the Victoria’s Secret girls, don’t expect us to act like soap opera guys.If you think you’re fat, you probably are. Don’t ask us. We’ve been tricked before!!If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway; it’s genetic.You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out.

Things were...well...good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Linux works on my laptop!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;Linux connects to the internet!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"&gt;From my laptop!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. So this may not be the most earth shattering life changing event ever to have befallen me. But it comes pretty damn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still doesnt like my stupid USB network adaptor on my backup pc. But hey. One miracle at a time.So what is the lord and saviour of my Linux experiance? Ubuntu! Good old lovely Gnome based Ubuntu. After what feels like eons of swearing by KDE I thougt id give Gnome a try. And lo, it was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologise if this post is boring the pants off you. Hmm, which if you happen to be a woman of the female persuasion conjurs up wonderful images...send any pics to pa....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...ok, maybe not. So anyway, I shall finish the post full of geeky goodness and go cheer on Peter Duncan on The Games. Cant believe hes 51!! Still remember him on Blue Peter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. Im typing this post on my lovely Linux fueled laptop so i`m as happy as a bunny in a carrot factory.Right. I feel better for that.\n",

Here’s a detailed account of what happened, and instructions on how to reproduce the “bug.” (from Bugzilla)    This privacy flaw has caused my fiancé and I to break-up after having dated for 5 years.    Basically, we share one computer but under separate Windows XP user accounts. We both use Mozilla Firefox — well, he used to use it more than I do but now we don’t really use it. The privacy flaw is this: when he went to log-in under his dating sites (jdate.com, swinglifestyle.com, adultfriendfinder.com, etc.), Mozilla promptly asks whether or not he’d like Firefox to save the passwords for him. He chose never, obviously. However, when he logged off his user account, and I logged onto my Windows XP account X amount of days later, I decided to use Firefox because hey — it loaded everything much more efficiently, was better to work on with website designs and is a lot more stable than IE7beta2.    Firefox prompted whether or not I’d like it to save my password for logging into my website. I chose never and changed my mind. I went into the Password Manager to change the saved password option from Never to Always and that’s when I saw all these other sites that had been selected as “Never Save Password.” Of course, those were sites I had never visited or could ever dream of visiting.    Then I realized who, how and what… and sh*t hit the fan. Your browser does not efficiently respect the privacy of different users for one system.    Reproducible: Always    Steps to Reproduce:       1. Create 2 unique user accounts (for steps sake, let’s call the two accounts Joe and Mary) in Windows XP Home.       2. Logout and sign-in under Joe.       3. Open Firefox and go to an e-mail site or to jdate.com or wherever.       4. Attempt to log-in to the site so that Firefox will ask whether or not you want your password saved.       5. Choose not to save the password.       6. After successfully logging in and having selected the “never save password” option, logout.       7. Log-in as Mary and open Firefox.       8. Browse, browse, browse… but you don’t really have to.

Maner was only 10 months old when Egyptian doctors, in a marathon 13 hour operation in February 2005, managed to separate the parasitic twin. The “twin” could do little more but blink and smile.Manar Maged case has been diagnosed as Craniopagus Parasiticus, an extremely rare condition where the embryo splits to form a twin but fails to develop separately and is attached to the head of the “normal” embryo. There have been other known cases, such as girl in the Dominican Republic, born in 2003, who did not survive the delicate and dangerous operation to remove the parasitic twin. As well, The Royal College of Surgeons in London displays the skull of the “Two headed boy of Bengal” who was born in 1783 but died in 1787 from a Cobra bite.\n",

But dont just fucking snub me and log off thinking I wont notice.Ok, I know I shouldnt take it personal. But I tend to behave online like I do in real life. Which is probably kind of scary. Well, I mean Im not rude, or ignore people or anything.

The most energy exerted was to get the guinea pigs in for a run around as all its done all day is piss it down.So slumped infront of the tv all day we have been watching motorsport on Eurosport. We ordered our MotoGP tickets for the Donnington Park race at the end of July…wooo. So looking forward to that. I have to keep Zara on a tight leash so she doesnt try n jump the barrier and radish Sete Gibernau!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Brother seems have an interesting bunch this year. All freaksm geeks, queers and a couple from Wales. Although the Jock poof is a tad annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, ill try and keep my Big Brother ramblings to a minimum.So now what.

        "excerpt": "Anybody who has been reading my ramblings for a while may remember a particular nasty post about a Chinese bitch who took part in a cat crush video. Well shes been found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is part of the story from &lt;a href=\"http://www.danwei.org/archives/002459.html\"&gt;http://www.danwei.org/archives/002459.html&lt;/a&gt;. No nastiness in it so its safe to read:Yesterday, someone posted a letter online accepting partial responsibility for the cat mutilation photos that have gotten people riled up. And the rest of the details of the case have now come to light.The Beijing News reports that the man in question, Li Yuejun, received 1000 yuan for recruiting the performer in the video. The woman in the video, a Ms. Wang, worked in hospital in Luobei County in Heilongjiang. The county government said that she was divorced, and a little not right in the head.Li did not shoot the video, however. Two employees of a Hangzhou Internet company were the producers of the film, and sent one to Heilongjiang to shoot it.And whats to be done with her? &lt;br /&gt;Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;No surprise really from a country that doesnt even recognise basic human rights. Im sure someone will hopefully 'inflict' some justice on her.&lt;br /&gt;And shes a nurse for fuck sake!Anyway here is the story of how she was tracked down. Again it`s safe to read, but a little long:HONK KONG: The photographic images, grabbed from a video clip that was on sale until recently on some websites, show a Chinese-looking woman in a slinky dress standing alongside a river and talking endearingly to a kitten that she holds in her gloved hands.But soon that ice-candy image gives way to a macabre scene as she places the kitten snipped nasty descriptionThere is, of course, no accounting for human perversions. Even so, the gruesome images from a ‘crush video’ that celebrates cruelty to animal as a sadomasochistic sexual stimulant set off a wave of revulsion among Chinese netizens and animal lovers.It also triggered one of the most enterprising online investigations driven solely by citizens (but which would do Scotland Yard proud), which culminated in the public shaming of the high-heeled cat-killer. Here’s a blow-by-blow account of how the civilian cyber-sleuths tracked down the culprit.Within days of the videos and photographic images being posted on the web, a Chinese netizen put out a ‘Wanted’ poster with the photograph of the woman and sought out Web-users’ help in identifying her and the location of the killing.The background images of a tower provided some clues. Professional tourist guides, who were shown the photographs, identified it as a landmark in a park in north-eastern Heilongjiang province.Further Web-trawling revealed that these images were part of a larger collection that was for sale on www.**.**. The website was soon closed down, but from the domain registration information, the sleuths gathered that the images had been uploaded in Hangzhou by a person bearing the handle of ‘gainmas’, with the mail ID info@winfox.com.A search on Google.cn — that accursed search engine that has been pilloried for doing business in China — for the telephone number listed on the site led the cyber-sleuths to a company with the name of Silver Fox Technology that was also listed at the same Hangzhou address.More personal details about gainmas came tumbling out rapidly: gainmas was shown to have a silver-grey Mazda with a Zhejiang registration, and a search on the auction site ebay.com.cn revealed that gainmas had purchased a pair of 12-cm-heeled shoes in January 2005.Meanwhile, another line of investigations was undertaken to track down the woman in the images. One red-herring was thrown at these sleuths, when one web-post claimed that the woman in the pictures was, in fact, Japanese, and that this was an advertisement for a well-known brand of Japanese shoes.Localising the search to Helongjiang province, the cyber-sleuths finally identified her Wang Jeu, a 37-year-old nurse at the Luobei People’s Hospital in Luobei county. Having been publicly identified and shamed, Wang earlier this week offered a public apology to animal lovers for her senseless, sadistic act.She claimed that she had been persuaded into performing for the camera at a time when she was in emotional turmoil following a divorce.The episode is striking for two aspects: it shows up the amazing possibilities of the Web, even in a society where information flow is restricted.But equally important, it shows what heightened civic consciousness and public outrage can do. The netizens who tracked down the high-heeled cat-killer of Luobei county are worthy of a place in the Cybersleuths Hall of Fame.\n",

He is now noticing that Wife 1.0 is also spawning Child Processes which are further consuming valuable resources. No mention of this particular phenomena was included in the product brochure or the documentation, though other users have informed him that this is to be expected due to the nature of the application.Not only that, Wife 1.0 installs itself such that it is always launched at system initialization, where it can monitor all other system activity. He’s finding that some applications such as PokerNight 10.3, BeerBash 2.5, and PubNight 7.0 are no longer able to run in the system at all, crashing the system when selected (even though they always worked fine before). During installation, Wife 1.0 provides no option as to the installation of undesired Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw 55.8 and BrotherInLaw Beta release. Also, system performance seems to diminish with each passing day.Some features he’d like to see in the upcoming wife 2.0.   1. a “Don’t remind me again” button   2. a Minimize button   3. An install shield feature that allows Wife 2.0 be installed with the option to uninstall at any time without the loss of cache and other system resources   4. An option to run the network driver in promiscuous mode which would allow the system’s hardware probe feature to be much more useful. I myself decided to avoid the headaches associated with Wife 1.0 by sticking with Girlfriend 7.0. Even here, however, I found many problems.

Apparently the versions of Girlfriend have conficts over shared use of the I/O port. You think they would have fixed such a stupid bug by now.

Animals, the furry and feathery fuc…little darlings we decide to share our lives with.They bring us great happiness and joy. Comfort. They can put our world in perspective. They help us through the crappy times just by giving you a look.And are always there to listen.Well, maybe not the cats. I’m sure they’re being sarcastic in their own way at times.And then there are the times when they just make you want to cry.Sooty, our 2 years (and a bit) old rats’ health is failing him fast.He’s off his food now, painfully thinning and wheezes terribly.It’s his age for sure. It doesn’t slow him down much, he’s a bit wobbly on his feet. But he’s more active than he’s ever been.Although Zara likened it to an elderly person who just wanders out their house one day and never comes back. Or is found ambling along down the M1.It’s a waiting game. Every morning I look into his house expecting the worse.I hope he’s not suffering. If he get’s much worse I guess a trip to the vets again will be the only course of action.Until then we’ll do our best to enjoy what little time we may have left with him. And try to make sure he doesn’t go charging out the back door and towards the garden shed again!UPDATE: Ok, he’s just fallen face first into my bath. I shouldn’t laugh. He’s giving me a look like it’s my fault!\n",

Mainly on how to put the jumble of thought in my head into any meaningful coherent sentences.&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure im actually there yet. But the house is empty so I really should make the most of the peace and quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a workmate.&lt;br /&gt;This workmate has a friend.&lt;br /&gt;And this friends' brother was killed yesterday in an accident at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My workmate was pretty shocked by it all as he had to drive his friend to the hospital, or parents, or something. I can't remember the detail now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't like a bolt of lightning hitting me, but slowly through the day little snippets of the past filtered into my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know exactly how this friend is feeling right now. The circumstances may be different. But the emotion is the same. It's the sort of thing you never forget. I can picture exactly where I was sitting when Tina (ex-wife) took the phonecall telling me my brother had been killed. Although the tv was on I cannot remember what program we were watching, which is kinda odd really considering how clear the rest of this image is inside my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember driving up to my parents house as fast as I could. Even though part of me didn't actually want to see the anguish on their faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember my mum's face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember we laid in bed pretty much half the night talking about him, drinking whisky until either raw emotion or alchohol made me fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember how the days and weeks and months afterwards all merged together. How nothing mattered. Everything seemed so trivial. I was floating. It all felt so...surreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember seeing my dad cry for the second time in my life. The first being when his mother died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Momentary flashes of the past kept coming in and out of focus. I tried to help my workmate, advise him on how to help his friend. And if there was anything I could do then just call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poor bastard has got everything I went through to come. As far as im aware nobody else was involved in this accident though. So at least this friend won’t have the overwhelming urge to kill the person who took the life of someone so close.An eye for an eye right.That feeling didn’t last long fortunately. All part of the anger. The feeling helpless. The wanting for someone to punished. To feel the hurt.I don’t cry now.Not until something like this brings it all back. Like someone has picked the scab off this raw emotion.And now the feeling are buried inside me again. Waiting to well up. I feel calm. I feel ok today.I just feel tired.\n",

His target was H&amp;J Leather &amp; Firearms, A gun shop specializing in handguns.2. The shop was full of customers - firearms customers.3. To enter the shop, the robber had to step around a marked police patrol car parked at the front door.4. A uniformed officer was standing at the counter, having coffee before work. Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a hold-up,and fired a few wild shots from a target pistol. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, the police officer with a 9mm Glock 17, the clerk with a .50 Desert Eagle, assisted by several customers who also drew their guns, several of whom also fired. The robber was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Crime scene investigators located 47 expended cartridge cases in the shop. The subsequent autopsy revealed 23 gunshot wounds. Ballistics identified rounds from 7 different weapons. No one else was hurt in the exchange of fire.Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt (Paderborn, Germany) fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm finally let it fly, and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop!Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the ailing elephant an olive oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on him. “The sheer force of the elephant’s unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top of him” said flabbergasted Paderborn police detective Erik Dern.

I was a suicidal 15 year old so I just said I wanted to be happy. I was asked again when I was at college.   now a suicidal 17 year old. I still didn’t know. I didn’t know at 20, 30 or 40. I’m now 51 and I still don’t know. Nor do I care now. I’ve sailed through life without any goal or vision. I’ve seen people i love die before their time. I’ve seen relationships crumble and dreams shatter. So I just keep floating through life.\n\nI’ve made half hearted attempts at life. I’ve had moments where things seemed to be going well_._ But they fade away eventually. I’ve been good, bad, selfish, selfless and on occasions illegal. But nothing seems to stick. I’ve thrown myself into interests 110% but eventually the bubble bursts and I’m looking for the next hook. The next thing I can cling onto in the hope it can catapult me through the rest of my life. It’s a lot to ask of something.\n\nThis all sounds so pointless as a life. We’ve only got one life so live it. So they say. But it’s like being given a book and told to read it. And enjoy it. It’s the only book you’re ever going to have. So make the most of it. So you slog your way through page after page of mundane story. Just hoping you can get through it quickly. To get to the end and breathe your last sigh of relief that it’s finally over.\n\nThe end.\n",

I never asked to be on the damn thing. But here I am, going through the same stomach-churning experience. Round and round. Up and down. Feeling sicker and sicker as time goes by.\n\nI want to get off. But I’m stuck on this damn thing because everybody I love is here with me. Going through various feelings of exhilaration and nausea of their own. And feeling like, “well, they’re here with me so I’d better stay on the ride”\n\nI do sometimes enjoy it. When it’s going slow, at the bottom where it feels like it’s virtually stopped. The calm before the storm.\n\nSo yeah. I don’t like Mondays. Or rollercoasters.\n",
