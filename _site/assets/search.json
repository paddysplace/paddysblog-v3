Got fireworks going off all over the place\nand i`m sick of hearing them. It`s gonna be worse tomorrow night. Sick\nof reading stories in the paper of twisted scum using fireworks on\nanimals. Tried to avoid a story in the paper about some thugs subjecting\na small dog to a firework attack that litteraly blew it to pieces! It`s\namazing that this country is such a nanny state, and supposedly fighting\nterrorism, yet every year these things that get more and more like small\nbombs are sold to the public like they`re damn sweets or something.\n\nWell, our cats are safely inside.

He would\nhave been 33.\n\nWe should be growing older disgracefully.\nWe should be painting our Warhammer 40k models in readiness for him to\nbeat me yet again on the battlefield, his Marines against my Orks.\nWe should be having marathon Red Dwarf-fests and eating too much pizza.\nWe should have been sitting infront of the tv on a Sunday when the World\nSuperbike season was on screaming at which ever british rider was on a\nDucati to win.\nWe should be going out on a Saturday night and I watch in awe as women\ngiggle all around him.\nI should have been getting him hooked on Neverwinter Nights so we can\ndungeon quest together.\nI should be doing my best to explain the rules to Magic the Gathering.\n\nBut we won`t. And i`ll not do many of those things without him. I`m\nlost without his unending quick wit and jokes that we used to bounce off\neach other. Usually at the expense of my ex-wife. Not that she minded,\nshe usually just slapped us round the head like two naughty kids.\n\nAnd that`s how we were. Despite all lifes hassles we never really grew\nup. Why am I writing all this now?\n\nI guess cos all these thoughts are bouncing around in my head. In a\nweeks time they might have faded into a frustrating mess inside my head.\nJumbled up like the rest of my thoughts usually are.\n\nI`m trying to decide how to spend the day.

It`s not my place to go into details. Even here\non my own blog so I`ll not. So some of this might sound a bit obscure.\n\nWe only met him once.\nAt a party. Last year.\nA bbq. We met a lot of family neither of us had met before.\nWe met her brother.\nHe seemed like a nice bloke.\nHe was a nice bloke, they were close.\nBut he suffered from depression.\n\nAnd today we learnt he`d commited suicide.\n\nI`d only met him briefly at the party but it hit me really bad. I\ndon`t know if it was because it reminded me of how I felt when I heard\nmy brother had been killed on his motorbike. Or the depression. Or the\nsuicide.\n\nI was 16 the first time. I didn`t know where my life was going, who I\nwas or why I was on this planet. A typical teenager I guess.\n\nI used to cut. If I felt low or unwanted I would take a razor blade to\nmy arm and make quick cuts across my arms and wrists. Wasn`t like I was\ntrying to kill myself, just hurt myself. Just a little.\n\nI was 16 and a friends party. She was more than a friend. Well to me she\nwas. We were close. But not in the way I wanted to be. I wanted more\nthan friendship. And she knew this. Our other friends said she used to\nlead me on a bit. But she didn`t she it. Anyway, at this party. I felt\nthat was the night we might get to be more than friends. I don`t know\nwhy. I`m a 16 yr old boy.\n\nSo we down drinks all night and she`s going round all her friends and\nsitting with us and laughing. And then her boyfriend comes in. Urgh. I\ndidn`t even know. I felt like i`d been punched in the chest. I had to\nget out.\n\nA mate agreed to take me home cos I was drunk and upset and banging my\nhead against the toilet wall. I hate myself for ruining his night.\n\nWe went back to his flat. I felt numb. Part drink, part emotion. I went\nto the toilet . I saw the razor blade. I don`t really remember much\nafter that except my mate screaming down the phone for an ambulance.\n\nI recovered. Got over her. Eventually and managed to go on with life\nwithout a dark shadow hanging over me.\n\nUntil I was 30 and I met C. My life wasn`t too good. My wife and I\nweren`t exactly the closest couple. My brother had been killed by this\ntime and my wife`s dad was dying from cancer.\n\nWe met up, things happened things went wrong. All this over the course\nof a few months. My wife`s dad died. The old feelings of being helpless\ncame back. I was 16 again.\n\nI sat at my computer and thought I couldn`t keep going on like this. I\ntook a plastic bag, put it over my head and tied it tight around my neck\nand waited for the oxygen to run out.\n\nI was hyperventilating when my mobile rang and it was C on the phone. I\nripped the bag off in a panic.

It`s not my place to go into details. Even here\non my own blog so I`ll not. So some of this might sound a bit obscure.\n\nWe only met him once.\nAt a party. Last year.\nA bbq. We met a lot of family neither of us had met before.\nWe met her brother.\nHe seemed like a nice bloke.\nHe was a nice bloke, they were close.\nBut he suffered from depression.\n\nAnd today we learnt he`d commited suicide.\n\nI`d only met him briefly at the party but it hit me really bad. I\ndon`t know if it was because it reminded me of how I felt when I heard\nmy brother had been killed on his motorbike. Or the depression. Or the\nsuicide.\n\nI was 16 the first time. I didn`t know where my life was going, who I\nwas or why I was on this planet. A typical teenager I guess.\n\nI used to cut. If I felt low or unwanted I would take a razor blade to\nmy arm and make quick cuts across my arms and wrists. Wasn`t like I was\ntrying to kill myself, just hurt myself. Just a little.\n\nI was 16 and a friends party. She was more than a friend. Well to me she\nwas. We were close. But not in the way I wanted to be. I wanted more\nthan friendship. And she knew this. Our other friends said she used to\nlead me on a bit. But she didn`t she it. Anyway, at this party. I felt\nthat was the night we might get to be more than friends. I don`t know\nwhy. I`m a 16 yr old boy.\n\nSo we down drinks all night and she`s going round all her friends and\nsitting with us and laughing. And then her boyfriend comes in. Urgh. I\ndidn`t even know. I felt like i`d been punched in the chest. I had to\nget out.\n\nA mate agreed to take me home cos I was drunk and upset and banging my\nhead against the toilet wall. I hate myself for ruining his night.\n\nWe went back to his flat. I felt numb. Part drink, part emotion. I went\nto the toilet . I saw the razor blade. I don`t really remember much\nafter that except my mate screaming down the phone for an ambulance.\n\nI recovered. Got over her. Eventually and managed to go on with life\nwithout a dark shadow hanging over me.\n\nUntil I was 30 and I met C. My life wasn`t too good. My wife and I\nweren`t exactly the closest couple. My brother had been killed by this\ntime and my wife`s dad was dying from cancer.\n\nWe met up, things happened things went wrong. All this over the course\nof a few months. My wife`s dad died. The old feelings of being helpless\ncame back. I was 16 again.\n\nI sat at my computer and thought I couldn`t keep going on like this. I\ntook a plastic bag, put it over my head and tied it tight around my neck\nand waited for the oxygen to run out.\n\nI was hyperventilating when my mobile rang and it was C on the phone. I\nripped the bag off in a panic. Running out of air is a horrible feeling.\nYour body starts panicing and you breath faster and faster to try and\nget what little air there is left into your lungs.\n\nMaybe I wasn`t serious about going through with it. But why did C ring\nup like that. It wasn`t planned. It was out the blue.\n\nBut I can understand how he could have killed himself. For me it was\nlove. Always is. For others it`s money. Or feeling a failure. Or losing\nyour job.\n\nI often wonder how far I would have gone if it hadn`t been for that\nphone call.\n\nA lot went on in those months to get me to that point.

The\nimages and videos of the woman killing kittens, puppies, rabbits and\ntoads began to surface last week on numerous internet sites.

Well she gets her kicks by doing crush\nvideos. This story is already causing outrage on the internet. The full\nstory can be read\nhere.\nBut I wouldn`t recommend it. It`s the most disgusting thing i`ve ever\nseen. Yes there are pictures.\n\nThe first paragraph reads:\n\n[A series of images and videos of a Chinese woman killing animals by\ncrushing them with stiletto heels has drawn outrage on the internet. The\nimages and videos of the woman killing kittens, puppies, rabbits and\ntoads began to surface last week on numerous internet sites. Since then,\na number of Chinese media outlets and amateur sleuths have been on the\nhunt for the mystery woman some have dubbed, \"The Kitten Killer of\nHangzhou”.]{style=”font-style:italic;”}\n\nPost the picture, post the link.

Garfield wants the sink tap on so he can have\na drink.\n\nSigh, it must be nice to relax in the peace and quiet after a hard days\nwork. I shouldn`t complain too much. Zara is working damned hard on\nthis bathroom. So i`m not. Complaining that is.\n\nAnd whilst I remember I shall introduce my newest tenant 3rd Times a\nCharm who has\npromised to be a model tenant and not leave pizza boxes everywhere.\n",

Books, vouchers, alchohol, clothes,\nalchohol.\nMe and Zara went to watch Silent Hill at the cinema. Yes, a nice\nromantic evening out.\n\nThen back to reality on Saturday as we attempted to not get stressed\nwith each other as we laid the bathroom floor tiles. Which went pretty\nwell. Only a few minor boo boos. Mainly to do with my cutting skills and\ntape measuring abilities.\n\nAnd yesterday we went to over to Leicester to meet Zara`s dad and his\npartner at Bradgate\nPark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich meant for a lot of walking.

In case any of you were wondering if I survived my\nbirthday.\nYou know who you are ;)\nI had a fantastic birthday.\n\nGot lots of great presents. Books, vouchers, alchohol, clothes,\nalchohol.\nMe and Zara went to watch Silent Hill at the cinema. Yes, a nice\nromantic evening out.\n\nThen back to reality on Saturday as we attempted to not get stressed\nwith each other as we laid the bathroom floor tiles. Which went pretty\nwell. Only a few minor boo boos. Mainly to do with my cutting skills and\ntape measuring abilities.\n\nAnd yesterday we went to over to Leicester to meet Zara`s dad and his\npartner at Bradgate\nPark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich meant for a lot of walking. A lot. So today i`m doing as little\nas possible. Nothin. Nadda. No bathroom. Very little walking. A relaxing\nday.\n\nHopefully.\n\nThe rest of the pics will be up on Flickr soon.\n",

Which isn't uncommon for\nrats. And one of my parents rats died so we're not having a lot of luck\nwith the rodents of this family.\n\n\n\nZara has just rushed upstairs to get her camera. As usual i'm typing\nthis in the bath. A nice, cool bath. Although ice cubes would be nice\nright now. Apparently we have a toad in the garden now. We've got a\npond with 3 goldfish, hundreds of water snails and 6 frogs! There's\nalso a bees nest under the pond.\n\n\n\nSo know doubt by now the poor toad will be blind due to Zara's camera\nflash going off in its face. Expect pictures soon! Until then you'll\njust have to make do with pics of the frogs.\n",

But the house is empty so I\nreally should make the most of the peace and quiet.\n\nI have a workmate.\nThis workmate has a friend.\nAnd this friends' brother was killed yesterday in an accident at work.\n\nMy workmate was pretty shocked by it all as he had to drive his friend\nto the hospital, or parents, or something.

In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the\nweaker brain cells, making the brain a faster more efficient machine.\n\nAnd that, Norm, is why you always feel smarter after a few\nbeers.”]{style=”font-style:italic;”}\n",

Must pre-order, must pre-order.\n\nMy brain age is currently 27 if anyone cares.\n\nSo it's good to know my mental state is quite young even if bodily I\nfeel 90. Although I blame the weather on that.\n\nToo. Damn, Cold.\n\nFor anybody, like me, who grew up in the 80s smoking, drinking and\nlonging to have sex with anyone who vaguely showed and interest then\nthis youtube video is for you.\n\nAlthough it show none of the above it does show the items we grew up\nwith and the things we saw on tv. A time when chocolate bars had proper\nnames.\n\nSo enjoy. And i'll try and post more often.\n\\\n\n\n\nAlthough I can't guarantee it'll be interesting, or make much sense as\nmy brain tends to regress to that of a child the nearer to Christmas it\ngets.\n",

Which, having forgotten about the\nfirst 'reminder' I'd also set.\n\nOh to have the brain of a guppy right now.\n\nThe car didn't pass its MOT. The car didn't even get the chance to be\nput through its MOT as the bonnet catch broke and they couldn't get the\ndamn thing open.\n\nWell before that little wobble in the life of me yesterday the past week\nhas been reasonably ok. Especially Wednesday when the boss was being his\nusual nobbish self and told us all to fuck off home.\n\nSo I did. Ah it felt good. And I still have a job. That'll teach him to\nchoose his words more carefully. Maybe. Probably not actually as he's a\nbit intelligently challenged.\n\nSo I finally got round to this wonderful blog post. On my wonderful new\nlaptop. Which is. Wonderful. I keep meaning to do a post using Vista's\nspeech recognition but due to the fact I can't understand me at the\nminute then I shall have to take rain check on this plan.\n\nAnd if nobody has realised i'm addicted to\ntumblr. It's so easy for lazy people like me\nto post stuff. I've stuck the rss feed on the right of my blog so you\ndon't even have to visit. But if you do want to then click\nhere. Yes, yes. I know i've\nmentioned this before. But if you read from the top of this paragraph\nthen you'll see the bit where I say i'm addicted. So gives me an\nexcuse to mention it as often as possible. Crappy memory or not.\n\nWell my laptop battery is about to die. My brain is about to dribble out\nmy ears and I can't think of anything else to say.\n\nPerfect place to stop methinks.\n",

Details of trial flights can be found here https://www.flyatfranks.org/trial-flight/ There. I`ve done my bit. This totally reads like a spam advert but it’s not :)\n",

I feel like I just float through life being buffeted by whatever comes my way.\n\nI remember being asked by the careers counselor at school what I wanted to be in life. I didn’t have a clue. I was a suicidal 15 year old so I just said I wanted to be happy. I was asked again when I was at college.   now a suicidal 17 year old. I still didn’t know. I didn’t know at 20, 30 or 40. I’m now 51 and I still don’t know. Nor do I care now. I’ve sailed through life without any goal or vision. I’ve seen people i love die before their time. I’ve seen relationships crumble and dreams shatter. So I just keep floating through life.\n\nI’ve made half hearted attempts at life. I’ve had moments where things seemed to be going well_._ But they fade away eventually. I’ve been good, bad, selfish, selfless and on occasions illegal. But nothing seems to stick. I’ve thrown myself into interests 110% but eventually the bubble bursts and I’m looking for the next hook. The next thing I can cling onto in the hope it can catapult me through the rest of my life. It’s a lot to ask of something.\n\nThis all sounds so pointless as a life. We’ve only got one life so live it. So they say. But it’s like being given a book and told to read it. And enjoy it. It’s the only book you’re ever going to have. So make the most of it. So you slog your way through page after page of mundane story. Just hoping you can get through it quickly. To get to the end and breathe your last sigh of relief that it’s finally over.\n\nThe end.\n",
