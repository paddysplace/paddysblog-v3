I was a suicidal 15 year old so I just said I wanted to be happy. I was asked again when I was at college.   now a suicidal 17 year old. I still didn’t know. I didn’t know at 20, 30 or 40. I’m now 51 and I still don’t know. Nor do I care now. I’ve sailed through life without any goal or vision. I’ve seen people i love die before their time. I’ve seen relationships crumble and dreams shatter. So I just keep floating through life.\n\nI’ve made half hearted attempts at life. I’ve had moments where things seemed to be going well_._ But they fade away eventually. I’ve been good, bad, selfish, selfless and on occasions illegal. But nothing seems to stick. I’ve thrown myself into interests 110% but eventually the bubble bursts and I’m looking for the next hook. The next thing I can cling onto in the hope it can catapult me through the rest of my life. It’s a lot to ask of something.\n\nThis all sounds so pointless as a life. We’ve only got one life so live it. So they say. But it’s like being given a book and told to read it. And enjoy it. It’s the only book you’re ever going to have. So make the most of it. So you slog your way through page after page of mundane story. Just hoping you can get through it quickly. To get to the end and breathe your last sigh of relief that it’s finally over.\n\nThe end.\n",

And the further away from my youth I get the stronger these thoughts become.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Take better care of yourself early on\n\n    Look after your body. Sure, it can recover quicker from a night out at 20. But you’re going to feel it later in life. Brush your teeth twice a day. Properly. And have breakfast.

        "excerpt": "\n\nI still consider myself new to running. I started about a year ago. Then injured my knee and been slowly getting back into it.\n\nAs with all things I threw myself into it 110%. Running every other day, Not exercising\n\n8 The Things I Wish I Knew\n\n\n  Slow and Steady\n  There’s Nothing Wrong With Walking\n  Rest Days Matter\n  Strength Training\n  Listen To Your Body\n  Never Compare\n  Drink Plenty of Water\n  Wear The Right Shoes\n\n\nThings I wish I knew before I started running\n\nSlow And Steady\n\nThe worst thing I did was go off like a greyhound, and keep going until it felt like my lungs would explode. Following the couch to 5k app with a mixture of running/walking helped slow down my pace. Which brings me onto\n\nThere’s Nothing Wrong With Walking\n\nUnless you’re trying to break a world record or get a PB then slowing down for a walk is ok. It’s preferable to pushng too far and risking injury. It doesn’t make you any less of a runner. It’s not cheating. And there’s nothing wrong with using walking and running to improve your fitness.\n\nRest Days Matter\n\nThis toook me a while to realise. In my excitement to begin my runninh journey I did way too much in the beginning. Running every moment I could, playing Ring Fit on the Nintendo Switch when I couldn’t. I was putting my body through too much too soon. Which might be ok when you’re younger. But at 50….not so much.\n\nStrength Training\n\nI thought all I needed to do was run. Increase my stamina. Run. Increase my strength. Run. Well turns out that wasn’t the best for my muscles. Lifting weights, using resistence bands. Even yoga that helps muscle groups is all important things to consider on your running journey.\n\nListen To Your Body\n\nThe single worst thing I did was ignore my aches and pains. I thought I was just old and out of shape. The more I run the looser my muscles will become. Wrong. No pain no gain. Doubly wrong. I was soon off work with a torn meniscus. Weeks of rest and weeks of physio and I’m finally back running. But i’m wary of pushing myself.\n\nNever Compare\n\nThe one contributing factor to my injury was getting a fitbit, uploading my times to fitbit and strava and seeing how my times stacked up to others. When I saw my pace was slower than a turtle in peanut butter then I pushed myself. Too hard. So remember:\n\n“Comparison Is The Thief Of Joy” - Theodore Roosevelt\n\nDrink Plenty of Water\n\nDehydration negatively affects your running performance and slows your ability to recover. It increases muscle fatigue and exhaustion. Drinking before a run is so so important. Drink when you’re thirsty. Seems like an obvious thing to say.\n\n“Feeling thirsty happens after you are dehydrated,” explains Dr. Martha Pyron, MD of Medicine in Motion. “You should try to prevent feeling thirsty.”\n\nWear The Right Shoes\n\n\n  Do your feet ache after a run, feeling numbness?\n  You can’t get your shoes off without completely loosening the laces\n  After a long run, your arches ache, your Achilles-tendon is tender, and/or you feel strain in your calves\n  Numbness or strain on the top of your foot\n  Your toes burn after a run\n\n\nChances are you aren’t wearing suitable shoes. Those ratty old trainers aren’t doing your feet any favours. I ended up going to a dedicates running shop. They analysed my running style and picked out a pair of running shoes. And they’ve been my best investment yet in my running journey.\n\nSo What did I learn?\n\nDon’t try to do too much too soon. Listen to your what your body is telling you. Don’t try to run through the pain. The risk of injury is very real. Try and get proper running shoes as soon as possible. And run for yourself. You can’t run too slow. But you can run too fast and risk injury. And stay hydrated!\n\nAnd try to run for fun. Your body will thank you.\n",

And there’s nothing wrong with using walking and running to improve your fitness.\n\nRest Days Matter\n\nThis toook me a while to realise. In my excitement to begin my runninh journey I did way too much in the beginning. Running every moment I could, playing Ring Fit on the Nintendo Switch when I couldn’t. I was putting my body through too much too soon. Which might be ok when you’re younger. But at 50….not so much.\n\nStrength Training\n\nI thought all I needed to do was run. Increase my stamina. Run. Increase my strength. Run. Well turns out that wasn’t the best for my muscles. Lifting weights, using resistence bands. Even yoga that helps muscle groups is all important things to consider on your running journey.\n\nListen To Your Body\n\nThe single worst thing I did was ignore my aches and pains. I thought I was just old and out of shape. The more I run the looser my muscles will become. Wrong. No pain no gain. Doubly wrong. I was soon off work with a torn meniscus. Weeks of rest and weeks of physio and I’m finally back running. But i’m wary of pushing myself.\n\nNever Compare\n\nThe one contributing factor to my injury was getting a fitbit, uploading my times to fitbit and strava and seeing how my times stacked up to others. When I saw my pace was slower than a turtle in peanut butter then I pushed myself. Too hard. So remember:\n\n“Comparison Is The Thief Of Joy” - Theodore Roosevelt\n\nDrink Plenty of Water\n\nDehydration negatively affects your running performance and slows your ability to recover. It increases muscle fatigue and exhaustion. Drinking before a run is so so important. Drink when you’re thirsty. Seems like an obvious thing to say.\n\n“Feeling thirsty happens after you are dehydrated,” explains Dr. Martha Pyron, MD of Medicine in Motion. “You should try to prevent feeling thirsty.”\n\nWear The Right Shoes\n\n\n  Do your feet ache after a run, feeling numbness?\n  You can’t get your shoes off without completely loosening the laces\n  After a long run, your arches ache, your Achilles-tendon is tender, and/or you feel strain in your calves\n  Numbness or strain on the top of your foot\n  Your toes burn after a run\n\n\nChances are you aren’t wearing suitable shoes. Those ratty old trainers aren’t doing your feet any favours. I ended up going to a dedicates running shop. They analysed my running style and picked out a pair of running shoes. And they’ve been my best investment yet in my running journey.\n\nSo What did I learn?\n\nDon’t try to do too much too soon. Listen to your what your body is telling you. Don’t try to run through the pain. The risk of injury is very real. Try and get proper running shoes as soon as possible. And run for yourself. You can’t run too slow. But you can run too fast and risk injury. And stay hydrated!\n\nAnd try to run for fun. Your body will thank you.\n",

With legs that looked like they could snap and a tired old face. No muscles to be seen. How could I ever think I’d belong in a place like this.\n\nI couldn’t run because of leg pain.
