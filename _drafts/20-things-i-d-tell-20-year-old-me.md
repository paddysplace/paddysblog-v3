Turning 50, and then very quickly turning 51 has got me thinking of what I'd tell my younger self if I could go back in time. For the longest time I'd say things like "no regrets" or "you only live once"

Looking back now I realise that was bullshit.

I have a ton of regrets and wishing I'd looked before I leaped. And the further away from my youth I get the stronger these thoughts become.

### What I'd Tell My Younger Self

**Take better care of yourself early on**

**You are stronger than you know**

**Always take care of your mental health**

**Don’t believe everything everyone tells you**. **Especially in the workplace**

**Work to live don’t live to work**

**Don’t take things so personally**

**Learn to embrace change**

**Maintain friendships**

**Don’t worry about what others think or about what they are doing**

**It’s ok to get out of your comfort zone sometimes**

**You are not your thoughts, you are the thinker of your thoughts**

**Always choose kindness**

**Spend more time together**
