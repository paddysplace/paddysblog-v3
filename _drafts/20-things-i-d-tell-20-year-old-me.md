Turning 50, and then very quickly turning 51 has got me thinking of what I'd tell my younger self if I could go back in time. For the longest time I'd say things like "no regrets" or "you only live once"

Looking back now I realise that was bullshit.

I have a ton of regrets and wishing I'd looked before I leaped. And the further away from my youth I get the stronger these thoughts become.

### What I'd Tell My Younger Self

 1. **Take better care of yourself early on**
 2. **You are stronger than you know**
 3. **Always take care of your mental health**
 4. **Don’t believe everything everyone tells you**. **Especially in the workplace**
 5. **Work to live don’t live to work**
 6. **Don’t take things so personally**
 7. **Learn to embrace change**
 8. **Maintain friendships**
 9. **Don’t worry about what others think or about what they are doing**
10. **It’s ok to get out of your comfort zone sometimes**
11. **You are not your thoughts, you are the thinker of your thoughts**
12. **Always choose kindness**
13. **Spend more time together**
14. **Everything happens for a reason**
15. **Focus on one thing at a time. You can have it all but not all at once**
16. **It's OK to be unsure about your purpose in life**
17. **Don't try too hard with people**
18. **stand up and speak out for what’s important to you**
19. **You are not the only person in the world who feels this way**
20. **Learn a different language**
