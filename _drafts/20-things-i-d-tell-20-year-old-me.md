Turning 50, and then very quickly turning 51 has got me thinking of what I'd tell my younger self if I could go back in time. For the longest time, I'd say things like "no regrets" or "you only live once"

Looking back now I realise that was bullshit.

I have a ton of regrets and wishing I'd looked before I leaped. And the further away from my youth I get the stronger these thoughts become.

 1. **Take better care of yourself early on**

    Look after your body. Sure, it can recover quicker from a night out at 20. But you're going to feel it later in life. Brush your teeth twice a day. Properly. And have breakfast. Not a quick sip of coffee as you head out the door after being up and dressed in five minutes.
 2. **You are stronger than you know**

    You can and will survive so many things in later life. It might not feel like it at the time but you can get through anything. Especially if you follow the next point.
 3. **Always take care of your mental health**

    This is the single most important thing I can tell myself. I can't stress this enough. Don't be afraid too get the help you feel you need. Do not let others around you influence you. They are not you. They are not the ones going through what you are. Listen to their advice. But the end decision lies with you.
 4. **Don’t believe everything everyone tells you**. **Especially in the workplace**

    Everybody lies.  Even if they don't realise they're doing it. Or even mean to. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt. Stay out of workplace dramas. And stay away from workplace relationships. They never work out.
 5. **Work to live don’t live to work**

    Not that I really need to tell myself this. Work isn't everything. Don't take the baggage of work home with you.
 6. **Don’t take things so personally**

    You need a thicker skin. Do not take whatever anybody says to heart. People will lie, manipulage, dictate and criticise anything about you. They are not you. And their opinion of you is none of your business. 
 7. **Learn to embrace change**
 8. **Maintain friendships**

 9. **Don’t worry about what others think or about what they are doing**
10. **It’s ok to get out of your comfort zone sometimes**
11. **You are not your thoughts, you are the thinker of your thoughts**
12. **Always choose kindness**
13. **Spend more time together**

14. **Everything happens for a reason**
15. **Focus on one thing at a time. You can have it all but not all at once**
16. **It's OK to be unsure about your purpose in life**
17. **Don't try too hard with people**
18. **stand up and speak out for what’s important to you**
19. **You are not the only person in the world who feels this way**
20. **Learn a different language**
