What a difference 48 hours can make..After my previous visit to the gym went [horribly badly](https://blog.thisispaddys.space/running/2021/08/12/a-running-low/ "Running low"), friday did a complete 180 and restored faith in myself

I wasn't going to let the gym win. It wasn't going to take the enjoyment out of my training. Mentally I went in ready to face my fears. And, I won. It, admittedly, did help by the fact the gym was fairly empty. The people in there were the same age, or older than me. I felt relaxed. All the tension that had melted away.

#### Game Plan

I was ready. I had a game plan. If the upstairs area with all the cross trainers, exercise bikes and treadmills was busy, i'd go downstairs and use the leg press and other torture devices. And visa versa. if both areas were busy i'd just go home and try again the next day.

##### Nobody is Judging you

Despite thinking you're going to be the center of attention, everybody is in their own little bubble trying to ignore everybody else. Chances are some are even as introverted as you.

_Your of the gym and certainty that I was being judged came from my thoughts and beliefs—not theirs._

##### Don't Compare Yourself To Others

This is a difficult, but important one. They aren't you, and you aren't them. You have to travel your own path.

##### Keep your workouts short

You don't need to spend all day in the gym. You don't need to be there for hours. An hour even. Small bursts of exercise throughout the day are just as effective as one longer session. Just 30 minutes of exercise is more than enough time to get in a great workout.
