It's been a month. Already? I know! Time flies when you're having fun.

So. What have I learned this month? Well, rather than being a small fish in a very big pond. I'm more of a speck of dust floating in the universe. This isn't a pity post. More of, say, a reality check.

The number of Pinterest pins claiming to double you page views. Help you start making $$$$ in as revenue. Become Master of the Universe in 3 easy steps is ridiculous.

I never expected to make a penny from blogging. And so far my predictions have been correct. I have nothing to say. No pearls of wisdom. Nothing that hasn't been said a thousand times before. And probably better.

So why do it? I'm not a social butterfly. I don't know a ton of people. I'm shy, introverted and quiet So why do I put myself out there?

No, really, why? I'd love to know, because I'll be buggered if I know!

I like to play around with new things. New services. New websites. It distracts me from the real world. It's the creation of something. It may be a boring old blog post that offers zero information or entertainment. But I guess it is just. Fun.

Playing around on canva creating crappy graphics. Signing up on form building sites that nobody will fill out. Looking at pitiful analytics of visitor counts.

It's all just fun. I like to make websites. Nobody will see them. Maybe that's what I'm missing. I'm just doing this for the enjoyment. Probably only me and my other half will ever read this and comment. Maybe my mum too.

I like to go running. I'm never going to be an Olympic athlete. So why do it? Sheer enjoyment. Although with running it doesn't usually feel like it at the time!

In an online world where everybody wants to be the best, earn the most. Get the most likes, page views, comments. Be noticed. I guess doing something for the self satisfaction seems a little strange.
