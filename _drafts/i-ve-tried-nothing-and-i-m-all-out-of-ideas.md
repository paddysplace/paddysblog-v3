It's been a month. Already? I know! Time flies when you're having fun. 

So. What have I learned this month? Well, rather than being a small fish in a very big pond. I'm more of a speck of dust floating in the universe. This isn't a pity post. More of, say, a reality check. 

The number of Pinterest pins claiming to double you page views. Help you start making $$$$ in as revenue. Become Master of the Universe in 3 easy steps is ridiculous. 

I never expeced to make a penny from blogging. And so far my predictions have been correct. I have nothing to say. No pearls of wisdom. Nothing that hasn't been said a thousand times before. And probably better.
