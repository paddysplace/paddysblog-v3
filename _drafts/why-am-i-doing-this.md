I'm a nobody. I guess we all are at some point in our lives. Maybe. Or maybe it's just me. 

I'm on all the usual social media sites under a different username. Got a few acquaintances and people that could be called friends following me. 

So why have I hit the reset button? Starting from scratch. Where nobody will read this. Nobody will follow me. I'm not a social person by nature. I don't have any words of wisdom or skills to offer the world.

I'm

1. A fifty something 
2. Vegan
3. With depression
4. Someone who likes the idea of friends. But doesn't like people. 

So why the hell would I want to attract people to read my very inarticulate blog, look at my mundane pictures  talk to a depressing introvert?

I think I'm trying to find myself again. I used to have a blogger blog back in the dark ages, and a livejournal and a Tumblr. I recently migrated my old blogger posts to this blog. It was interesting going over them again. Like finding an old diary.
