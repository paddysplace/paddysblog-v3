12-3am The time I sometimes lay awake. Knowing I need to get to sleep.

3-6am Little G will need to go out sometime.

6am My alarm goes off.

6:10am my alarm goes off.

6:20am my alarm goes off.

6:30am my alarm goes off.

7-8am I try and survive the morning cat feed, preparing my lunch, getting breakfast. And make a half hearted attempt to be ready and at work for 8am

8:10am arrive at work

8:10am-4:30pm spend the day in my own pit of hell having to work with some of the dumbest people I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. 

4:30-8:30pm This could go either way. Depending on the kind of day Zara has had will dictate everything, from the mood of the cats to affecting every ounce of me being. 

8:30-10pm This will be stressful regardless. 

10-12pm
