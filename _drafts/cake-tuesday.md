## Cracking Cake Gromit

My mum always has been a fan of Wallace and Gromit. More of a Gromit fan to be honest. Designing a cake around her favourite characters made Zara's life so much easier when coming up with birthday cake ideas.

I think Zara could have made a W&G cake every year and my mum would still have loved it.
