Keeping Focus

I can feel it happening. It's not like the bubble bursting. More like, it's slowly deflating.

I've gone from going flat out, foot to the floor. Pedal to the metal. Well, you get the idea.

The latest shiny new thing in my life is starting to dull.  I don't know how it starts. What triggers it off. But the slow decline of an interest begins a new upward trajectory in my depression. And it's really annoying.

So why does it happen? What causes me to lose interest in something, anything.

There's no time scale. It can be days, weeks or months later. When I feel I'm getting into my stride. The slow hiss of escaping air from the bubble begins. Until it's deafening.

I'm not going to have any answers unfortunately. There are better bloggers, better Google searches you could do to find more accurate, relevant and interesting information than you'll find here.

Maybe this post is just a rant about my current state of mind.

**Why do I lose interest?**

How can I avoid this?

Can I reignite the spark?

The one slight silver lining in this very dark cloud is. Yes. Well, sometimes.

I've lost interest in learning a new language due to frustration, only to try again months later. Oh I still got frustrated and dropped it again.

Ok, bad example. Web development. Got a few books, learned a bit of html, CSS and suchlike only to again drop it due to frustrations in my limited abilities.  But. I started again along with my new found love for blogging.

Blogging and web development seem to go well together. They feed off each other. And I'm finding that I'm still learning. Well. I was. Despite the initial excitement, I can feel the bubble starting to wobble.

I'm hoping it's a natural wobble that, probably, every blogger goes through. Especially in the early days.

I need to just go with the flow. I saying I've used throughout my life, but one I struggle with following the older I get.

Not every wobble ends in disaster. It's just a speed bump. I need to slow down. And just focus on the road ahead. Easier said than done. But one I need to learn from.

Otherwise, why bother starting anything new in the first place.
