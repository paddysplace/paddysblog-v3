Keeping Focus

I can feel it happening. It's not like the bubble bursting. More like, it's slowly deflating.

I've gone from going flat out, foot to the floor. Pedal to the metal. Well, you get the idea. 

The latest shiny new thing in my life is starting to dull.  I don't know how it starts. What triggers it off. But the slow decline of an interest begins a new upward trajectory in my depression. And it's really annoying.

So why does it happen? What causes me to lose interest in something, anything.

There's no time scale. It can be days, weeks or months later. When I feel I'm getting into my stride. The slow hiss of escaping air from the bubble begins. Until it's deafening.

I'm not going to have any answers unfortunately. There are better bloggers, better Google searches you could do to find more accurate, relevant and interesting information than you'll find here. 

Maybe this post is just a rant about my current state of mind. 

Why do I lose interest?

How can I avoid this?

Can I reignite the spark?
