# Running For Your Mental Health

Running regularly at a moderate or vigorous level can improve your mental health.

Running outside has other benefits, like lessening feelings of loneliness and isolation.

Running can reduce stress, depression, and anxiety.

### Runners High

You breathe faster, your pulse gets quicker and your heart pumps blood around your body harder. Your body releases endorphins.

Endorphins are the chemicals produced naturally by the nervous system to cope with pain or stress.

This burst of endorphins released during exercise has long been referred to as the runner's high.

### Walk, Jog or Run?

Whatever you feel comfortable doing. There is no right answer. We're all different, so do what makes you happy. There's no point running if you're not enjoying it. There's nothing to gain from pushing yourself, and punishing yourself.

And then...

### So Now What?

This was going to be the one. The blog post where I'll do a ton of research. Write a ten thousand word essay on the benefits of running and accelerate my blog into the stratosphere.

The trouble is. I've burnt out already. I started off fairly well in the opening few lines. Full of enthusiasm. My brain bursting with ideas. But then.

The trouble with mental health is that the highs can feel wonderful. But the lows.

I guess blog writing can be very similar to running, or any exercise. It's fun in the beginning. You're on the path to something new. Something exciting. This is it. I can see the future now. I'll be blogging every moment i can. I'll be reading about blogging, listening to podcasts, checking out apps, templates, tips and tricks. And now you're going 100mph. This is great. But then.

Just replace blogging with running.

It's like somebody flicks a switch. The fire dims, the excitement wanes. You have no energy for this. You think back to when it was exciting and new. And the depression deepens. It's worse if this new found passion injures you in the process.

#### It's all about the pace

It's too easy to get caught up in it all. Pacing is everything. Focus is everything. I'm trying to write this at the same time as working. It's going to be a mess. But now I think I just need to get the words out. Regardless of if they're informative or helpful.

I don't think I've really felt the runners high. At the moment every run is a reminder that I could injure myself again. The motivation has gone. I'm still trying to push myself to keep at it. I want to. I need to do this. I need something and this feels like it's it. It has to be. Because at the minute there is nothing else.

I have a goal in sight. Parkrun. Surrounded by dozens of strangers all excited to be there. I'm hoping their enthusiasm will rub off on me. Maybe I'll even talk to somebody. Which is unlikely as I'm woefully introverted. Maybe that's will kick start the endorphins enough to make me feel alive. And to belong. Maybe despite everything i need other people. People to run with. People going through depression. People that might understand. Me.

Every evening I have the intention of going for a run in the morning. I only ever run in the morning. There's hardly any people about, it's cooler, I'm more awake. There's hardly any people about. The thought of people seeing me running sends shivers down my spine. If I could afford a treadmill and had the space I'd probably run more often. I could hide away in my own four walls and run to my heart's content. 

Which is completely at odds with aiming for a parkrun where I'll be surrounded by....people! But like-minded people. Maybe even people like me. People who _will_ understand. My people. Hopefully. 

The conflict between wanting to belong to a group and shun everybody has been going on my whole life. And hiding away has always won.

But as I get older. As I realise time is marching on I can't let the part of me that wants to hide keep winning. 

Oh this bit is easy. Hiding behind a screen, posting on social media where the barrier between me and other people is the internet. I need to move that to the next level and into the real world. That's where the mental health and running pairing will be strong enough to get me through the absolute terror my brain will be going through. Hopefully. Eventually. 

I've signed up. Registered my name. Got my parkrun barcode. I just need to...go. I could walk the entire 5k if I wanted. I could walk, with the occasional jog. I can go round the course however I want to. No judgement. 

**So why don't I?** 

I'm using the excuse that I'm not ready. I'm not fit enough. I need to finish the coach to 5k plan. I need to feel all the aches and pains I'm feeling aren't going to be made worse.

So I don't go. Like every morning I wake up at 6am and stare out the window. Willing myself to get up and go for a run. And nearly every morning I just lay there staring out the window until it's too late. Until I have to get ready for work. Oh well, maybe tomorrow. 

#### Conclusion

Running is good for your mental health. But it's not a magic wand. You still have to push yourself just a little to get out the door and run. Or walk, or jog.

It's a bit of an uphill battle to be honest. And one I'm still fighting. There'll be a tipping point. As long as I'm patient. Don't lose focus. Don't try and push it along too fast. Just go at a steady pace and hopefully the burn out won't happen. The runners high will come and that will propel you to the next run, and the next.

I wish I had some otherwise unsaid words of profound wisdom.

But I don't. I'll just end, like all good blog posts do. With a list of links. Hopefully somebody will find these useful if they're ever unfortunate enough to come across this in a Google search.
