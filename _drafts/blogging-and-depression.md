# Running For Your Mental Health

Running regularly at a moderate or vigorous level can improve your mental health.

Running outside has other benefits, like lessening feelings of loneliness and isolation.

Running can reduce stress, depression, and anxiety.

### Runners High

You breathe faster, your pulse gets quicker and your heart pumps blood around your body harder. Your body releases endorphins.

Endorphins are the chemicals produced naturally by the nervous system to cope with pain or stress.

This burst of endorphins released during exercise has long been referred to as the runner's high.

### Walk, Jog or Run?
