What Is Motivation?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation):

> Motivation is what explains why people or animals initiate, continue or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time.

You Are Your Brain

While everything we feel is nothing more than a collection electrical impulses and chemicals and hormones, it's important to remember that you are your brain. 

It is not some separate entity making every decision without your input. What motivates you on an existential level can't be explained entirely by biology alone. 

Motivation is the desire to achieve a goal, which is a lot more complicated than a single process. 

_Why you are motivated depends entirely on what the change means to you, why you want to pursue the change, what supports you can access to sustain the change, etc._

Loss of motivation

> Apathy is the destroyer of progress. 

At least that's how I see it. That's the feeling I get. It's not a feeling of sadness. It's nothing. The feeling of emptiness and life's borders growing beyond your grasp.

So here I sit. Thinking of all the jobs I should be doing. All the chores around the house. It's not laziness stopping me. It's something else.
