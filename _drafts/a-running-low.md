## Feeling the runner's ~~high~~ low

I should be happy. But I felt like a fraud today. I felt out of place at the gym. 

I saw myself in the mirror whilst on the leg press. 

This, skinny old man stared back at me. With legs that looked like they could snap and a tired old face. 

I couldn't run because of leg pain. I just felt useless. I'm failing c25k and I'm doubting my ability to run. I'm twice the age of everybody around me. And feeling every one of those years. 

Maybe tomorrow will be better.
