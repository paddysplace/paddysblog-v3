Burns, who was diagnosed with an astrocytoma, a form of brain tumour, in November 2003 passed away last night Friday 25th November peacefully.  His partner Zoe, family and close friends were at his bedside.<br /><br />From the outset Richard knew that the odds were heavily against him and yet he fought his illness with bravery and good humour.  Having undergone both chemotherapy and radiotherapy he was able to leave hospital in summer 2004. For a while his health showed signs of improvement but then after six months it once again began to decline.  Determined not to give up, he opted for  surgery earlier this year.  This alleviated some of the symptoms of his illness and enabled him to remain active.  At Castle Combe in August he attended a parade of the rally cars that he drove throughout his career and was touched by the warmth of the reception he received. However there was to be no miracle and in recent days he lapsed into a coma. <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Taken from <a href="http://www.richardburns.com/">http://www.richardburns.com/</a></span>
