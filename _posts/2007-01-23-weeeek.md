https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2007/01/weeeek.html \-\-- Can\'t
believe it\'s been nearly a week since my last post.\
And I hope my reader(s) haven\'t been feeling neglected, but I can\'t
say i\'ve missed blogging.\
\
It\'s just laziness. I\'m out of the groove. I get settled in the bath
ready to write another rant and then think, ahh, this is nice and warm.
Relax.\
\
And all the anger just washes away.\
\
My hand hurts though.\
\
I punched the shed door in a moment of frustration. I can\'t say i\'ve
been feeling particularly calm this last week or so. No one thing is to
blame. Jut life I guess. Money. The usual things.\
\
Living with a stubborn head strong, yet slightly indecisive girl
doesn\'t help. Joking honey ;)\
\
So i\'m finally uploading the videos of us playing the wii over
Christmas. It\'s still January so I think it still falls under the
festive season umbrella. I\'ll blog them as soon as they\'re uploaded.\
\
Which might be sometime in February going by my track record.\
\
So there you go. After a week waiting for me to say something deep and
meaningful you get a few lines of waffle.\
\
Meh, Life eh.
