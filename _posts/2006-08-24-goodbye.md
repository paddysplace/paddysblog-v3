https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/08/goodbye.html \-\-- This will
be my last post for some time. This will come as a shock to some of you,
but I have made the monumental decision to take off for the rest of the
year.\
\
There are a number of reasons, but the major contributor to my decision
has been my involvement with a guerrilla group in Venezuela, which is
fighting for freedom and justice against unbelievable odds.\
\
I have been in contact with this group for a number of years by email,
and now will finally join them. I know most of you will think I am
totally crazy - - but I have not made This decision lightly.\
\
Nothing you can say or do will stop me from doing what I truly believe
in. I realize the timing is terrible and my family will suffer - - but I
hope to see you again in happier days -when I return from my mission!\
