23 days without a post. 23 days without a rant.<br /><br />That can't be right. <br /><br />I`m tired. Tired of everything right now. I've been full of cold for a while and I think it's getting me down and starting to skew everything out of perspective.<br /><br />That's right. You wait 23 days for some sign of life from me and this is what you get. Assuming anyone is still reading. Umm...hi Kitty.<br /><br />I have no energy. I feel like just curling up in a ball in bed. But that doesn't pay the bills. Put food on the table and all that crappy stuff you have to deal with day in day out.<br /><br />I need a rest. A long long permanent holiday away from it all. But unless I win the lottery then that's never gonna happen. <br /><br />I need a new job. The daily grind of the shithouse I'm in is slowly killing me. The backbiting, the management (for want of a better word!), the day in day out mind-numbing boredom of what I have to do for 8 hours a bloody day.<br /><br />I need to get out more. Or escape more, into books, films a new computer game. Something that takes me away from real life. Something I can envelope myself in for a few hours. Or maybe just get out more.<br /><br />I need to focus. My head is a shed. My thoughts are everywhere. I sign up to new sites add a ton of people then get bored of it all and move on.<br /><br />I'm just tired. Got no energy. I`m restless.<br /><br />Christ this must be fun to read! Although it helps hammering it out on the keyboard again. So maybe i'll feel a little better after hitting the 'publish post' button.<br /><br />I'll still be tired though.
