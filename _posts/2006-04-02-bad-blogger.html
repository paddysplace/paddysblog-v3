Damn it`s late. Or is it early.<br /><br />Well I`ve been a bad blogger the past few days. Just adding links I find interesting and nothing else. Or is that part of blogging? hmm. Maybe I don`t have to keep posting deep and meaningful stuff ALL the time.<br /><br />I`ve been lazy I think. I haven`t been reading and commenting in the blogs I reularly read. And i`m feeling kinda guilty for it. Although not many have commented on my stuff.<br /><br />Humph<br />Yes i`m a comment whore.<br />AND nobody has left me any voicemail messages.<br /><br />So double humph.<br /><br />I don`t mind. Much. My visitor counter is slowly creeping to 1000 visitors. Which I find kinda exciting in my sad own little way.<br /><br />And yet again i`ve failed in my landlordly duties and haven`t introduced my new tenant. So before her week is up please go and visit the very lovely and slightly deranged (in all the nicest ways) Chase over at <a href="http://www.tastetheworld.org/">Taste the world</a>. Oh, and don`t forget to comment!
