https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/01/long-day.html \-\-- Well i\`m
just waiting for my bath to finish running then i\`m off for a relaxing
soak and listen to the [Mike Tech Show](https://www.miketechshow.com/)
for some good ol\` geeky podcast fun.\
\
Made a tentative start to demolish the bathroom for our new suite, which
we bought today. Put AVG on my dad\`s computer (and instantly found a
Trojan\...yeah, thanks Norton AV!) and just finished watching
Madagascar.\
\
So a busy day. Managed to stay calm, relaxed and reasonably stress free
so nothing to rant about. In short\...i\`m feeling mellow.\
\
Although this Belgian beer i\`m drinking is helping.\
\
So I shall introduce my first blogspace rentee.
[Beanhead](https://www.beanheadbabbles.blogspot.com/), who I picked for
having some decent taste in music and films (i.e. Saving Private Ryan,
and Guns n Roses) and has the coolest Blog title pic i\`ve seen so far.
Ahem, other than [gemmak\`s](https://www.jmw500.blogspot.com/) of
course!\
\
So now dear reader I shall depart and continue this mellowness in a nice
hot bath.
