I can`t decide weather to be shocked, disgusted or amazed at what breeders are doing.<br /><br />This is a snippet from the website <a href="http://www.toygerbreed.com/">www.toygerbreed.com</a><br /><br />--<br />    The Toyger is a designer cat. It is designed and bred with the demands of modern apartment life as a human companion foremost in mind. Glittered, pelted, dramatic pattern appeals to both the high-tech glamour and nature-loving, wild dreams of city-caught people while the laid back, easily trained character of these cats make them a joy to live with.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.toygerbreed.com/images/nice_toyger.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px;" src="http://www.toygerbreed.com/images/nice_toyger.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />    The Toyger is a breed in development.
