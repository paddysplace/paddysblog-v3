\-\-- Made my first skype to skype call earlier! ok it wasn\`t to talk
to a person. Got to leave a voicemail message to a podcaster. The
MikeTechShow is one of the coolest podcasts around. I spend most of my
days listening to podcasts instead of music on my ipod. Anyway, left a
typical nerdy \'i think your show is great\' type message so it wasn\`t
exactly a momentous occassion. Took me most of the damn afternoon
getting my headphone settings right so I could hear properly. Wasn\`t
until I found the volume control on the headset that I realised what was
going wrong!\
\
Anyway, skype me if you\`ve got it. I\`ve got voicemail so leave a
message so I feel all warm n popular!
