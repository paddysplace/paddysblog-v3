..wall left to demolish that is.<br /><br />Miss me?<br /><br />Didn`t think so...humph. I felt 'funny' not posting yesterday. <br /><br />So, back to the wall. Been thumping lumps out the walls again. Both of us. Without arguing! Whodda thunked it!<br /><br />Anyway, it`s going well so far. The ripping out is the easy bit tho I think. But that`s my bit. The technical bit is for others to get headaches over, heh.<br /><br />Between that and trying to get Linux running on my backup PC for no other reason than because I want to...i`m sure i`ll do a geeky tech rant over this sometime this week. Got Mandriva running on the laptop. Just need to get the wireless connection working on it now.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />Why do I try these things.
