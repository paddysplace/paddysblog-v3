https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/02/mad-world.html \-\-- Ok, so
i\`m trying to write this whilst watching 24 on Sky One. But just had to
get it out my system. It\`s another political rant i\`m afraid.\
\
It seems these riots over the cartoons aren\`t going to end anytime
soon. And it seems the \'We hate Denmark\' campaign has turned into
another excuse to blame America. Now i\`m not an expert on all things
political or religious to do with this, or any of the troubles in the
Middle East. And the entire Muslim can not be held responsible for the
actions of a percentage of nutcases. But when the only headlines you
read are along the lines of\
\
Muslims Assault U.S. Embassy in Indonesia\
4 Dead in Afghan Protests Over Drawings\
Iranian Paper Plans Holocaust Cartoons\
Afghan Rioters Demonstrate Over Cartoons\
\
Then you have to wonder how the Islamic faith can be viewd as anything
but violent.\
\
And how can this be explained if the Mohammed is not allowed to be
depicted in any way?\

Double standards? Or the cartoons just another excuse for the radicals
to vent their hatred for the West.
