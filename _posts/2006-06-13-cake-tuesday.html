Back by popular demand. Well, not that I heard from any concerned readers, humph. But Zara was demanding it.<br /><br />Anyway, here is this weeks cake. Zara's Gran collects porcelain fairies. If I remember this is a copy of one of the models she has. Aagain, i'm sure Zara will put me right :)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/Fairy%20Cake.3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/Fairy%20Cake.3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/Fairy.3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/Fairy.3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Not my sort of thing, But as always i'm speechless at Zara's talent. And her Gran loved it.
