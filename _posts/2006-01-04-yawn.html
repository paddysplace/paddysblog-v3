This week is going way too quick. Maybe it`s because i`m sleeping the morning away!<br />I`ve never slept so much in my life. I really am going to have to get to bed earlier and try and wake up a bit earlier each day in preparation for next week!<br /><br />Was round at my parents until 11:30 last night watching the video I took of my gf`s sisters kittens.<br /><br />I really should add a few more videos to our '<a href="https://uk.geocities.com/paddee28/">Our Cats</a>' page on geocities.<br />Haven`t added anything to that in sooo long. I`m terrible, I start these little projects then get sidetracked and start something else!<br /><br />I blame the cats personaly...mainly because all these projects usually involve them!
