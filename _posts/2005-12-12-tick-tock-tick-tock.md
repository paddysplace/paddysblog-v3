Ok, so i\`m laid in the bath with the laptop at my side getting slightly
tingly!\
\
No, not for anything like that you pervy people.\
\
In less than 6 mins the first of my lego castle items goes on ebay,
it\`s currently at £6.58. I cannot believe how much i\`m gonna make on
all my old lego. A load of lego space stuff went yesterday and 15 items
are going today, a few more quid and i\`ll have made £500!!!\
\
So why am I writing all this drivel here!?\...i\`ve gotta do something
to pass the last few minutes before the auctions start to end!!\
\
I need a drink! I just keep thinking of all the lovely things I could
buy with it, knowing full well it\`s all gonna go towards a new fridge
freezer. Which we do need.\
\
Ok, less than a minute to go\...time to go sit on ebay and hit f5 a
lot!!
