R[ICHARD BURNS]{style="font-weight:bold;"}\
17 January 1971 - 25 November 2005\
\
It is with very great sadness that we must announce the death of Richard
Burns, the 2001 FIA World Rally Champion. Burns, who was diagnosed with
an astrocytoma, a form of brain tumour, in November 2003 passed away
last night Friday 25th November peacefully. His partner Zoe, family and
close friends were at his bedside.\
\
From the outset Richard knew that the odds were heavily against him and
yet he fought his illness with bravery and good humour. Having undergone
both chemotherapy and radiotherapy he was able to leave hospital in
summer 2004. For a while his health showed signs of improvement but then
after six months it once again began to decline. Determined not to give
up, he opted for surgery earlier this year. This alleviated some of the
symptoms of his illness and enabled him to remain active. At Castle
Combe in August he attended a parade of the rally cars that he drove
throughout his career and was touched by the warmth of the reception he
received. However there was to be no miracle and in recent days he
lapsed into a coma.\
