Excuse me folks whilst I have another I hate people moment. Yet again
thanks to those Chink fuckers and their wonderful \'traditional
medicine\' bullshit.\
\
Taken from
[IFAW](https://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx?oid=3)\'s
website:\
\
[Saving Moon Bears from Lives of Torture \--
China]{style="font-weight:bold;"}\
\
Asiatic black bears, commonly called "moon bears," suffer terribly on
Chinese "bear farms" where crude catheters are implanted in their
stomachs to drain the bile from their gall bladders. The bile is used in
Traditional Medicines (TM).\
\
IFAW is working to eliminate bear farming, provide humane treatment for
bears currently imprisoned on "farms," and to promote herbal
alternatives to bear bile in TM.
