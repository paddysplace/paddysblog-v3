\
Shelves and cupboards are on the list of things to do this weekend. I\`m
getting pretty good with the ol\` cordless drill and making nice neat
holes in the tiles.\
\
So as I lounge here in the bath this is the view I get of our nice,
slowly becoming organised, bathroom. It might look a little blurry but I
like my bath hot!\
\
So it\`s cupboards tomorrow then the floor to do. Then finally.\
\
Finally.\
\
We\`ll be finished!!\
\
Then it\`s my birthday. Which I really am doing quite badly at hinting
about I think.\
\
6 days to go people.
