\-\-- Another problem solved. Just waiting for my personal tester
[gemmak](https://www.jmw500.blogspot.com/) to give me the all clear.
Damn tag-board. Served me right I guess for not reading the site
properly about popups in the free version.\
\
As I use firefox all the time I never saw them. Anyway, all is fixed and
using [shoutbox](https://www.myshoutbox.com/start/?LANG=US) now. Seems a
lot better.\
\
Well i\`ve got [bloglines](https://www.bloglines.com/),
[blogrolling](https://www.blogrolling.com/),
[del.icio.us](https://del.icio.us/), [frappr](https://www.frappr.com/)
and [43 things](https://www.43things.com/) running on my blog, is there
anything i\`ve missed I should be adding? :).\
\
I think i\`m addicted to adding these things.
