Well some more of our Bradgate Park visit pics are up on Flickr. Although I`m sure Zara will point out that i`ve missed off some of the better ones.<br />I`m so lazy at picking pictures.<br /><br />Speaking of pictures. Zara has a nice shiny folder on her hard drive with nice shiny pictures of some of the cakes she`s done. She did want me to post a cake of the day, but I thought i`d be able to stretch it out to doing one a week,.<br />And as I didn`t think anyone would be interested in me doing a bralesss tuesday a`la <a href="http://boredhousewife.blogspot.com/2006/05/tuesday-is-it.html">Bored Housewife</a>. Then I thought Cake Tuesday would be a much better idea.<br /><br />So here it is. <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/Bath%20cake.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/Bath%20cake.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />The first cake posting. It`s a birthday cake Zara did for me. And as you all know I like to post in the bath. And previously I used to like to read in the bath. So Zara captured me in a perfect pose....although I wondered why she was taking all these photos of me laid in the bath!<br /><br />She even managed to get all my piercings in there as well, reading PC Format and with Miaow asleep by my side. Note the strategically placed bubbles.
