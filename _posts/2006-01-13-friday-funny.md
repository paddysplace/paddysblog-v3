noticing a few changes, the old couple decide to go to the doctor for a
checkup. The doctor tells them that they\'re physically okay, but they
might want to start writing things down to help them remember.\
\
Later that night while watching TV, the old man gets up from his chair.\
\
His wife asks, \"Where are you going?\"\
\
\"To the kitchen\" he replies.\
\
\"Will you get me a bowl of ice cream?\"\
\
\"Sure.\"\
\
\"Don\'t you think you should write it down so you can remember it?\"
she asks.\
\
\"No, I can remember it.\"\
\
\"Well, I\'d like some strawberries on top, too. You\'d better write it
down because you know you\'ll forget it.\"\
\
He says , \"I! can remember that! You want a bowl of ice cream with
strawberries.\"\
\
\"I\'d also like whipped cream. I\'m certain you\'ll forget that, so
you\'d better write it down!\" she retorts.\
\
Irritated, he says, \"I don\'t need to write it down, I can remember it!
Leave me alone! Ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream - I got
it, for goodness sake!\"\
\
Then he grumbles into the kitchen.\
\
After about 20 minutes the old man returns from the kitchen and hands
his wife a plate of bacon and eggs.\
\
She stares at the plate for a moment and says - \"Where\'s my toast?
