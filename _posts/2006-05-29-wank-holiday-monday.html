Bit of a title eh!<br />Well, it`s not so wank now. But that`s how I felt earlier on. And all thanks to three little letters.<br /><br />D<br />I<br />Y<br /><br />I`m getting past the point of hating DIY to near violent tendancies.<br />I wasn`t really in the mood today. But I guess that`s what Bank Holiday`s are for.<br />Still finishing off the last fiddly job in the bathroom. Nothing major. Just a bit of trim around the bath to tidy it up a bit.<br /><br />But, God, i`ll be pleased when it`s done. It`s partly my own fault as I do my best to put off doing it. That and just the thought of it gives me a headache.<br /><br />I also introduced Zara to the joys of Cleethorpes.<br />Which killed off a couple of hours yesterday.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0529Image0005.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0529Image0005.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0529Image0020.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0529Image0020.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0529Image0007.0.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0529Image0007.0.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0529Image0017.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0529Image0017.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Beaches were walked along, ice-cream was eaten and crazy golf was played. Perfect day.<br /><br />Mainly cos I won at crazy golf. Woo Hoo!
