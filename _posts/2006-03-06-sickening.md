https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/03/sickening.html \-\-- Ok, this
post will probably be upsetting. So if you\`re easily shocked then
don\`t read anymore!\
\
Just had to blog this as I feel completely sickened by it. It\`ll
probably do no good, but if the picture and story is spread then maybe
someone will catch this bitch.\
\
Anyway. Have a good long look at this woman.\

She looks kinda normal right? Well she gets her kicks by doing crush
videos. This story is already causing outrage on the internet. The full
story can be read
[here](https://www.ogrish.com/archives/new_chinese_crush_videos_causing_outrage_Mar_06_2006.html).
But I wouldn\`t recommend it. It\`s the most disgusting thing i\`ve ever
seen. Yes there are pictures.\
\
The first paragraph reads:\
\
[A series of images and videos of a Chinese woman killing animals by
crushing them with stiletto heels has drawn outrage on the internet. The
images and videos of the woman killing kittens, puppies, rabbits and
toads began to surface last week on numerous internet sites. Since then,
a number of Chinese media outlets and amateur sleuths have been on the
hunt for the mystery woman some have dubbed, \"The Kitten Killer of
Hangzhou".]{style="font-style:italic;"}\
\
Post the picture, post the link. Spread the word.\
\
China. The country with no animal protections laws.
