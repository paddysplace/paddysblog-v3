Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem <br />to be breathing and his eyes are glazed.<br /><br />The other guy takes out his phone and calls the emergency services.<br /><br />He gasps: "My friend is dead! What can I do?"<br /><br />The operator says: "Calm down, I can help. First, let's make sure he's <br />dead."<br /><br />There is a silence, then a gunshot is heard.<br /><br />Back on the phone, the guy says: "OK, now what?"<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />A woman gets on a bus with her baby.<br /><br />The bus driver says: "That's the ugliest baby that I've ever seen. Ugh!"<br /><br />The woman goes to the rear of the bus and sits down, fuming.<br /><br />She says to a man next to her: "The driver just insulted me!"<br /><br />The man says: "You go right up there and tell him off - go ahead, I'll hold <br />your monkey for you."<br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />A man and a friend are playing golf one day at their local golf course.<br /><br />One of the guys is about to chip onto the green when he sees a long funeral <br />procession on the road next to the course.<br /><br />He stops in mid-swing, takes off his golf cap, closes his eyes, and bows <br />down in prayer.<br /><br />His friend says: "Wow, that is the most thoughtful and touching thing I have <br />ever seen. You truly are a kind man."<br /><br />The man then replies: "Yeah, well we were married 35 years."
