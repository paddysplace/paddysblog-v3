2 days in and I need another break from work already. My morning starts at:<br /><br />7:10am Zara's Alarm goes off<br /><br />7:15am My radio alarm goes off<br /><br />7:20am My mobile phone alarm goes off<br /><br />7:25am My mobile phone alarm goes off<br /><br />7:30am My mobile phone alarm goes off<br /><br />Ok, i`m getting out of fuckin bed.<br /><br />7:55am Go to work<br /><br />12:30pm Wake up<br /><br />What happens between the hours of 8am and my dinner at 12:30 is a mystery. But i'm sure I must be working as I haven't been sacked yet.
