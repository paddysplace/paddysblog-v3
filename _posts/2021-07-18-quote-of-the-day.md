The older I get, the more this sentence resonates with me. I don't know if I'm just getting more cynical, jaded. If I'm just surrounded by such people that their negativity is rubbing off on me. If it's world politics, events, or the pandemic. I just know there's an overwhelming aura of despair that blankets my entire view.

There are moments of happiness that poke through the holes in this blanket. Little points of light shining through. But these don't last long. Like coming up for air, flailing in the deep waters. These brief moments of sweet, fresh air are soon lost in the dark, unforgiving water. 

I think that's enough terrible analogies that only a 15-year-old emo kid would be happy with. I'm 51, and the older I get the more these jaded thoughts are strengthened. Maybe I need to surround myself with more positive people. They must exist out there somewhere.
