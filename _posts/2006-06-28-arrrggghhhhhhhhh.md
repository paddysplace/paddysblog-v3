There thats better.\
\
Well, as it\'s been a few days and i\'ve already missed Cake Tuesday I
thought i\'d better get back into the blogging swing of things.\
\
So what has Paddy been up to since Friday I hear you ask.\
\
I can quickly sum it up in 2 words.\
Food\
Drink\
\
Saturday: BBQ at Zara\`s Dads. Lots of food, lots of drink\
Sunday: 60th Birthday Party. Lots of food, LOTS of drink\
Monday: Meal at friends house. Lots of food. Noooo more drink!\
\
So yesterday it was back to work, urgh. I think i\`m still catching up
on sleep from the weekend. Although I\`m not exactly going to bed early
which won\`t help any.\
\
Although the week hasn\`t exactly gotten off to the best start. Zara\`s
computer decided to die so i\`ve been doing my best to get her up n
running before she clogs up my pc with all her pictures and survey
emails (joking honey).\
\
Although I do wonder if it\'s worth it. I\`ve cannibalised my spare
computer for parts, backed up all her documents to my hard drive.
Reformatted her hard drive, reinstalled windows.\
\
And I know she thanked me. But I feel like she\`s disapointed with my
efforts.\
\
I\`m really tired atm which doesn;t help my perspective on things. And I
know she is as well.\
\
So maybe I should leave it there before this turns into a rant.
