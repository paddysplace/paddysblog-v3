https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2005/12/ho-ho-ho.html \-\-- Well i\`ve
sobered up enough from the Christmas bash to write a blog entry. Started
drinking at 1pm and finished at about 5pm, which doesn\`t sound long,
but it doesn\`t take me long to get pissed. Especially on an empty
stomach.\
\
Anyway, I kept losing at pool.\
\
So, i\`m soaking in the bath. Just for a change. And shall be attempting
some food later.\
\
I was up at 6:45am and on my way to Tesco to purchase chocolate products
for my nearest and dearest.\
\
Unfortunately the place was already heaving and the roads were filled
with people who I guess had never driven a car before.\
\
What is it about Christmas that makes people lose the ability to drive!
I swear the past few days I\`ve come up against more looney drivers than
I have all year.\
\
I don\`t mind when i\`m in the works van because i\`m bigger than these
little piddly cars. But when i\`m pootling in my punto (heh), it\`s
another matter!\
\
Well, i\`m preparing for semi-hibernation, and don\`t have to go back to
work until the 9th (yay!).\
\
So the Christmas spirit is well and truly in me now!! (stop sniggering,
didn\`t mean it like that!)
