Well I wasn`t even awake properly and I managed to upset my girlfriend.<br /><br />By some bizarre twist of fate my girlfriend was wide awake first thing this morning and I was soooo sleepy.<br /><br />So she did her best to wake me up, which pissed me off. Cos when I`m awake I just get up and play on the pc.<br /><br />So I stuck my ipod on and started drifting off again. <br /><br />So now she`s grumpy with me. And I haven`t even got out of bed yet! <br /><br />Sigh, so now i`m laid here all alone as even the cats have abandoned me.<br /><br />Ok, my attempt at sympathy is over.
