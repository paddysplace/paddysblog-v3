The purpose of the meme is to get to know everyone who participates a
little bit better every Thursday. Visiting fellow Thirteeners is
encouraged! If you participate, leave the link to your Thirteen in
others comments. It's easy, and fun! Be sure to update your Thirteen
with links that are left for you, as well! I will link to everyone who
participates and leaves a link to their 13 things. Trackbacks, pings,
comment links accepted!\
