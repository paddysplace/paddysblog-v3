\-\-- I\`ll try and stay awake until the end of this post.\
Hmm, hope you will to!\
\
It\`s been such a lazy day today. We\`ve done nothing. The most energy
exerted was to get the guinea pigs in for a run around as all it\`s done
all day is piss it down.\
\
So slumped infront of the tv all day we have been watching motorsport on
Eurosport. We ordered our MotoGP tickets for the Donnington Park race at
the end of July\...wooo. So looking forward to that. I have to keep Zara
on a tight leash so she doesn\`t try n jump the barrier and radish Sete
Gibernau!\
\
Big Brother seems have an interesting bunch this year. All freaksm
geeks, queers and a couple from Wales. Although the Jock poof is a tad
annoying.\
\
Ok, i\`ll try and keep my Big Brother ramblings to a minimum.\
\
So now what. I\`m sat here staring at the screen trying to think what
i\`ve been up to, what\`s on my mind, what I\`ve got to do and nothing
is coming up. My eyes are tired, i\`m looking at Garfield who is fast
asleep. And Zara is\...still awake, writing emails.\
\
I have a good excuse for stopping writing now as my laptop batter is
nearly dead.\
\
So i\`ll go now before it runs ou\....
