I think i'm coming down with something.<br />All the signs are there. The signs Zara had before she got ill. And has now passed on said contagion to me.<br /><br />Hopefully it won't come to anything. I haven't been ill in a long time. I was always catching colds as a kid. But as i've got older (but not necessarily grown up) i've become a bit hardier to the little beasties that try and infect me.<br /><br />I'm on holiday for the next week, I can't decide if getting ill is good timing or bad.<br /><br />Again, hopefully it won't come to anything.<br /><br />So i'm going to have as relaxing a week as possible. Until Friday anyway. Which probably doesn't mean a lot to people who don't read this often. Or don't know me.<br /><br />You'll find out if things get too much and a sudden rush of emotion comes out via the keyboard (read back to this time last year if you really want to know).<br /><br />I'm doing a little better this year for some reason. Up 'til now. Not so many downs. But i'm trying not to let things prey on my mind.<br /><br />A nintendo DS is wonderful for occupying your mind!<br /><br />My brother would have loved it :(<br /><br />Damn, there I go. First crack in the armour.
