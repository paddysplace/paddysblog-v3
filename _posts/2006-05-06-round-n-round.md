what a day.\
\
At the minute Zara is regaling me with facts about Keifer Sutherland so
if this post goes off on a tangent you\`ll know why!\
\
It\`s been hot today. Too hot. I don\`t like hot. It makes me tired and
grouchy.\
I suffer from vertigo. But for some strange reason my anti-deps seem to
control my dizzy spells.\
Well until today that is. It didn\`t last long but it felt like a scary
moment. We were at my parents and I started to feel really, really
sleepy. Zara will probably tell you it\`s because she was rambling on
about her wonderful work day at the windmill.\
And then\...zing!\
I get really hot, my head starts to pound and the dizzy spell hits me.
It only lasted a few seconds thank God. But just for a moment I thought
\'oh no, not again\'\
\
In the bad old days it could leave me on my back for 3 days. I\`m hoping
it\`s not coming back. It takes over my life and i\`m too scared to go
anywhere in case it happens again.\
We were meant to go to Cleethorpes this afternoon. But after that I just
wanted my bed. Fortunately we both felt a bit worn out and the rain had
started. So we just went home.\
\
I hate my body controlling me. But i\`m just left so helpless.
