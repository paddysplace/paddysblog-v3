https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2005/10/blog-post.html \-\-- My
girlfriend is in a right state. Her sis has been texting her all evening
so far. It\`s so hard seeing her upset and being so helpless. Her sister
doted on Amber, she was like a little child to her. She was her life,
and now it\`s gone. Life really does suck sometimes.\
\
We only saw her (Amber) yesterday, and now she\`s dead. She was laying
on our bed, playing. It doesn\`t seem real. At least whoever hit her had
the decency to take her to the vets. But the vet said she wouldn\`t have
known what hit her so didn\`t suffer. Which is something I guess.\
\
It doesn\`t help (in some ways) that we have Garfield, Amber\`s brother.
My girlfriend just looks at him and bursts into tears.\
\
Some people probably think this is all a bit much. Getting so upset over
a cat. But our animals are more than that. They\`re a part of our
family. And to be honest, a lot more preferable to people sometimes.
