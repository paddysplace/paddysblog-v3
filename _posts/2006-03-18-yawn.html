Well it`s been a long day today. By long day I mean, short day. And by short day I mean didn`t get out of bed until after 3pm.<br /><br />And i`m still tired. I think laying in bed all day has the opposite effect on me. The longer i`m there the rougher I feel. Still it wasn`t an unproductive lay in bed.<br /><br />No. Now get any dirty thoughts out your head. Well, maybe leave a couple in there.<br /><br />But no. I had a breakthrough. Success was found to be tasting so sweet. Things were...well...good!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Linux works on my laptop!</span><br /><br />And<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Linux connects to the internet!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">From my laptop!!</span><br /><br />Ok. So this may not be the most earth shattering life changing event ever to have befallen me. But it comes pretty damn close.<br /><br />Still doesn`t like my stupid USB network adaptor on my backup pc. But hey. One miracle at a time.<br /><br />So what is the lord and saviour of my Linux experiance? Ubuntu! Good old lovely Gnome based Ubuntu. After what feels like eons of swearing by KDE I thougt i`d give Gnome a try. And lo, it was good.<br /><br />I apologise if this post is boring the pants off you. Hmm, which if you happen to be a woman of the female persuasion conjurs up wonderful images...send any pics to pa....<br /><br />...ok, maybe not. So anyway, I shall finish the post full of geeky goodness and go cheer on Peter Duncan on The Games. Can`t believe he`s 51!! Still remember him on Blue Peter.<br /><br />Anyway. I`m typing this post on my lovely Linux fueled laptop so i`m as happy as a bunny in a carrot factory.<br /><br />Right. I feel better for that.
