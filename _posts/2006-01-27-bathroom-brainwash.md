Ok, I think Zara has been going on about bathrooms for so long it\`s
started to affect me. Not sure I should be blogging this as she\`s bound
to want it.\

Anyway, according to [this
sites](https://www.inhabitat.com/entry_236.php) blurb these tap systems
[\"also feature temperature sensitive LEDs lining the walls of the
canyon, which illuminate the water in different colors depending on the
temperature of the water\"]{style="font-style:italic;"}\

I think they\`re pretty cool\...which has me even more worried!
