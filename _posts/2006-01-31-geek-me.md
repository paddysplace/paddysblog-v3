https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/01/geek-me.html \-\-- Sigh. Any
Linux experts reading this know how to get a Geforce MX/MX400 to play
nicely with Mandriva?\
\
Not had the best tech day. I even loaded up Skype to be greeted with my
first voicemail message\....for someone else!\...arggh!\
\
I\`m tired.\
I\`m getting a cold\
Things don\`t want to work for me.\
\
All this makes for a grumpy Paddy.\
\
So now all you nice people leave me lots of lovely comments, voicemail
messages and chat messages and i\`ll try and cheer up a bit.\
\
Hmmm, who says i\`m a comment whore ;)\
\
Oh and whilst you\`re at it. Anybody fancy buying the domain name
nlgw.com. My boss has it plastered on the side of one of our work vans
but hasn\`t actually bought the domain name!\
\
I would gladly pay for someone to do it (just so it doesn\`t get traced
back to me!) just to see the look on his face. Oh, and it\`ll save me
having to do the website for him.\
\
See, grumpy and vindictive.\

Maybe I should go take it out on the bathroom walls. Zara took a piccy
of me all ready for some demolishing action! Scary huh!
