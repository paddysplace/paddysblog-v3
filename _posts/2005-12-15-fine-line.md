https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2005/12/fine-line.html \-\-- Hmm, so
how far does someone have to go before crossing the line between being
sarcastic and down right arrogant?\
\
A guy I work with is dangerously close to being nothing more than an
arrogant little twat. If he isn\`t already in some people\`s eyes.\
\
I get on ok with him, but that last couple of days I could seriously
have damaged him.\
\
It\`s not like he gets personal or anything. It\`s just his attitude. He
can\`t have a single conversation without getting all sarcastic about
something or someone. I agree with what he\`s saying a lot of the time.
Hell, i\`ve even stood up for him.\
\
But now it\`s like his confidence is really warping into arrogance.\
\
I\`m looking forward to the holidays and getting away from all of them.
So much for goodwill to all man!
