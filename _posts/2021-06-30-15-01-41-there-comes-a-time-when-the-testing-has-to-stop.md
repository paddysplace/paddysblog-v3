And I really wish it was now. Every app I tried has worked a little bit. So. That time is now. 

I don't **need** to have my posts published immediately. I'm not breaking any news. There's no exclusives or scoops to be put online the soonest possible second. 

There's only me. But I also don't like things not working properly. So I guess all this will be saved in drafts until I get home and can edit the front matter on my Chromebook for the post to play nicely on my blog. But, I guess at least this has given me something to write about. Unless I really mess it up and lose it all!
