Today has been good.<br />Actually today has been fucking excellent.<br />It all started well by me n Zara beating each other.<br />Er, at Mario Kart DS and Tetris that is.<br /><br />If I see another cool video showing off the Wii i'm gonna explode. Either that or Zara will really beat me!<br /><br />So how was today also a good day.<br />Well.<br />Nicky Hayden only won the 2006 MotoGP championship. Woo<br />Woo.<br />And woo again.<br />Also another reason for Zara to do me in as i've been like a kiddy in a candy/DS store.<br /><br />Best. Race. Ever. Although I didn't actually watch much of the race. Instead I was glued to my laptop with the timing screen on.<br /><br />Ok, I imagine none of you reading this has the faintest idea what i'm babbling on about.<br />But damnit. It's my blog , so I'll woo as much as I want.<br /><br />Woo.<br /><br />Ok, i'm done now.<br /><br />Not the most exciting news to many, not the most interesting thing I've got to say about my whole weekend. But it'll do for now.
