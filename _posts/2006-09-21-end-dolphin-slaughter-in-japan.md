\-\-- During drive hunts, migrating pods of dolphins and other small
whales are first panicked and confused by loud banging, then herded, by
the hundreds, into shallow coves and butchered, one by one, by
fishermen. Every year, some 20,000 small cetaceans of several species,
some of which are endangered, including bottlenose dolphins, striped
dolphins, spotted dolphins, Risso's dolphins, short-finned pilot whales,
white-sided dolphins and false killer whales, are killed or taken in the
drives, sometimes illegally.\
