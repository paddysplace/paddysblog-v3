This is the Pulitzer prize winning photo taken in 1994 during the Sudan
famine. The picture depicts a famine stricken child crawling towards an
United Nations food camp, located a kilometer away.\
\
No one knows what happened to the child. Including the photographer,
Kevin Carter, who left the place as soon as the photograph was taken.\
\
Three months later he committed suicide due to depression.\

This was found in his diary ,\
\
[Dear God, I promise I will never waste my food no matter how bad it can
taste and how full I may be. I pray that He will protect this little
boy, guide and deliver him away from his misery. I pray that we will be
more sensitive towards the world around us and not be blinded by our own
selfish nature and interests.\
I hope this picture will always serve as a reminder to us that how
fortunate we are and that we must never ever take things for granted.
