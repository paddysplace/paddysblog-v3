\-\-- This story is in all the papers today\...if anybody knows her
address i\`d love to pay her a personal visit! Apparently she\`s only
been jailed for 6 weeks.\

A sick mum took revenge on her annoying cat by boiling it to death in
the washing machine.\
\
Fluffy took up to ten minutes to die --- breaking his claws as he tried
desperately to escape, a court heard.\
\
Holly Thacker, 34, said the cat became \"weird and a bit vicious\" and
had started living outside the house. JPs were told she admitted her
crime to her horrified ex-husband and daughters, aged 15 and five. She
said she killed the cat because it scratched her.\
\
Husband Simon, thought she was joking at first --- but then Thacker
showed him the animal's body in a wheelie bin.\
\
Simon told the Norwich court: \"The cat was dead and soaking wet. She
said it was a boiling wash. I told her it was disgusting and cruel.\"\
\
Vet Mark Bestbier said the terror the cat suffered while drowning was
revealed by broken claws on all four paws.\
\
He said the reddish colour of the dead cat's skin showed the water she
drowned in was warm.\
\
He said: \"The disorientation of a rotating drum and the filling with
water would have been a terrifying process.\"\
