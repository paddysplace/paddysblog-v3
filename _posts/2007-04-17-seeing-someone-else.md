Yes. I\'m guilty. I\'ve been playing elsewhere and have been spending
less and less time with you.\
It\'s not you.\
Well maybe partly it is.\
There\'s less complications with this other one.\
Nicer looks too.\
But don\'t take it personally. I\'ll keep with you until the bitter
end.\
I still have feelings for you and that\'s what matters.\
This new one is just..well\...different.\
\
Of course i\'m talking about blogs here. And by blog I mean my new fave
obsession, and by obsession I mean
[here.](https://paddysplace.tumblr.com/)\
\
My private, or not so private thoughts, cake tuesday and the like will
still be posted here. But the other crap I find on the internet will be
over on my tumblr site. As well as the other dozen sites i\'m addicted
to at the minute.\
\
I\'ll try not to let this blog fall into disrepair.\
Maybe I just need to spread my wings a bit.\
Try a change of scenery.\
\
That sort of thing.
