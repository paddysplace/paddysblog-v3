\-\-- I\'m feeling lazy. And as Zara has been going click happy with her
new camera then I thought the best\...ie easiest thing to do would be to
just post a bunch of pictures.\
\
I\'ve been so slack in posting things that\'s been happening. Not that
anything earthshattering has been happening, but still.\
\
Anyway, i\'m still attempting to learn French. I\'ve been listening to
the new Iron Maiden album like mad, and done nothing but eat and drink
all weekend with Zara\'s dad and partner who came up to visit us.\
\
So\...on to the pictures!\
\
Animally ones first\
