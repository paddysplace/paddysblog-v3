\-\-- God, I ache. My aches aches. Aches are aching my ache
aches\...ache\...well, you get the idea.\
\
I\`m off back to work for a rest. This foreman I have to live with is a
slave driver ;)\
\
Been doing Tim \'the toolman\' Taylor type stuff today. Got to be all
manly and mess about with big bits of plasterboard and powertools.\
\
And I must say i\`m quite pleased with my days work. Although it did
take me 3 hours to get the first board up! Even managed to put a few
tiles up. Well, about 4 actually. But it\`s progress.\
\
So now I ache.\
\
And I have very little to say. My day has been filled with sawing and
drilling and sticking and nailing. And getting cut by the most evil tape
measure i\`ve ever used.\
\

But just remember me when it gets round to my birthday, heh. Hmm, maybe
I should put an amazon wishlist up ;)\
\
Well, it\`s worth a shot.\

Ok, my brain is falling asleep now. Time to rest
