Under pressure again.<br />Gotta type fast before my laptop battery runs out.<br /><br />Which won`t be easy as i`m in the bath with the lights off so I can barely see my keyboard. I am slightly touch type proficient ie. I can finf the delete key really quickly!<br /><br />Why am I in the bath with the lights off?<br /><br />Well we still haven`t finished the bathroom yet so no curtain is up at the window and I really don`t like the thought of my neighbour across the road seeing me shake my thing as I get out the bath...especially as it`s not even half nekkid thursday yet.<br /><br />So. I`m in a happy mood. I`m free, untethered, I have thrown off the shackles of wired networking once more!<br /><br />Yes. My new wireless access point arrived today. No longer do I feel the restrictive bondage of the cat 5 rj-45 cable.<br /><br />So no matter what crap life throws at me this week I shall brush it aside knowing my laptop if free to roam the house.
