Well i`m feeling kinda bad. We sold a ton of lego on ebay and made a pile of money. But as I work all day I had to leave my girlfriend to package up all the items. Which most of the time isn`t a problem.<br /><br />But we had a lot of Lego...a LOT.<br /><br />She did a fantastic job. But she gets stressed easily. Which gets me stressed cos I think she blames me for the way things go wrong when she is stressed. Or something like that.<br /><br />So I get all arsey. <br /><br />But I really do appreciate everything she does.<br /><br />I guess i`m writing all this cos I know she`ll read it.<br /><br />I`m also in a funny mood because of my brothers birthday on Sunday. So i`ve been doing my yearly ritual of changing the layout and stuff of my pitiful excuse for a website.<br /><br />I started messing with making a website soon after his death. Make like a little memorial or something. It kinda helped me through it in a way. The pictures page is only partly done. I`m hoping to have it done before Sunday. Dunno why. It just seems to help.<br /><br />Anyway, it`s at <a href="https://homepage.ntlworld.com/paddee/">https://homepage.ntlworld.com/paddee/</a> if you feel like looking.
