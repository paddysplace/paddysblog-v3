\-\-- Had a better day today. Amazing what a good nights sleep will do.
Considering I had a cat welded to my side all last night I think I slept
pretty well!\
\
Had to take Garfield (the cat in question) to the vets yesterday to have
his yearly vaccination. I think we need a bigger cat box! was a bit of a
nightmare getting him in the thing. Altho he was quiet all the way there
bless him. He\`s been sleepy all day today so i\`m wondering if we can
give him an injection every day to keep him calm\....joke!\
\
I tried sending a post to my blog via my mobile phone, but it didn\`t
seem to want to work. I shall keep trying until it does work tho, lol. I
don\`t like it when these things are meant to do wonderful things then
don\`t. I take it personally, lol.\
\
Well it\`s time I did my little ritual of checking my fave websites,
gmail, digg, ebay, bloglines, flickr. It\`s a bit sad I know, but i\`d
hate to miss something exciting n techy I could bore my girlfriend rigid
with!
