https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/04/fame-success.html \-\-- I have
to type quick tonight.\
I\`m under pressure.\
Not only does Supernatural start in less than 5 mins now but if I don\`t
write anything then I don\`t think Zara will let me get into bed.\
\
You\`d think we don\`t talk to each other.\
She likes to get her daily dose of Paddy\`s Prattling.\
And this from the woman who lives with me!\
\
Ok, so if this post of prattling is full of typos and makes less sense
than usual then you\`ll understand why.\
\
So where does the Fame & Success come from in today\`s title. In another
fit of full on nerdyness I got slightly excited (not THAT excited) when
I heard my voice talking to me from my Ipod.\
\
Yes my voicemail concerning Skype with Ubuntu was played in the
MikeTechShow podcast. Yay. He even answered my query and commented on my
3 previous failed calls to his voicemail line whilst trying to use Skype
under Ubuntu.\
\
Anyway, the problem is half solved\...if anybody cares!\
\
Next on the list is getting my Ipod to talk nicely with Ubuntu.\
\
So there you go. Not exactly earthshattering. Not gonna win me any
prizes or get my name up in lights. But in my own little way it made me
smile.\
\
I know. I\`m sad.\
\
Supernatural will be on in a minute, Zara will want to read my waffling
and then the world will be a happy place again.
