\-\-- What is it with blogger that it keeps dying at night. Again,
getting a post in whilst it lets me! Thanks to my friend
[Deanna](https://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-Q_7Epz0zeqiNeLKGEhnUqmGWqRtrtw--?cq=1)for
sending me this.\
\
As we grow up, we learn that even the one person that wasn\'t supposed
to\
ever let you down probably will.\
\
You will have your heart broken probably more than once and it\'s harder
every time.\
You\'ll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was
broken.\
You\'ll fight with your best friend.\
You\'ll blame a new love for things an old one did.\
You\'ll cry because time is passing too fast, you\'ll eventually lose
someone you love.\
\
So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you\'ve\
never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute\
of happiness you\'ll never get back.\
\
Don\'t be afraid that your life will end, be afraid that it will never
begin.
