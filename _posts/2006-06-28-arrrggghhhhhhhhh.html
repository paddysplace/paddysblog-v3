There thats better.<br /><br />Well, as it's been a few days and i've already missed Cake Tuesday I thought i'd better get back into the blogging swing of things.<br /><br />So what has Paddy been up to since Friday I hear you ask.<br /><br />I can quickly sum it up in 2 words.<br />Food<br />Drink<br /><br />Saturday: BBQ at Zara`s Dads. Lots of food, lots of drink<br />Sunday: 60th Birthday Party. Lots of food, LOTS of drink<br />Monday: Meal at friends house. Lots of food. Noooo more drink!<br /><br />So yesterday it was back to work, urgh. I think i`m still catching up on sleep from the weekend. Although I`m not exactly going to bed early which won`t help any.<br /><br />Although the week hasn`t exactly gotten off to the best start. Zara`s computer decided to die so i`ve been doing my best to get her up n running before she clogs up my pc with all her pictures and survey emails (joking honey).<br /><br />Although I do wonder if it's worth it. I`ve cannibalised my spare computer for parts, backed up all her documents to my hard drive. Reformatted her hard drive, reinstalled windows. <br /><br />And I know she thanked me. But I feel like she`s disapointed with my efforts.<br /><br />I`m really tired atm which doesn;t help my perspective on things. And I know she is as well. <br /><br />So maybe I should leave it there before this turns into a rant.
