What is it with blogger that it keeps dying at night. Again, getting a post in whilst it lets me! Thanks to my friend <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-Q_7Epz0zeqiNeLKGEhnUqmGWqRtrtw--?cq=1">Deanna </a>for sending me this.<br /><br />As we grow up, we learn that even the one person that wasn't supposed to<br />ever let you down probably will. <br /><br />You will have your heart broken probably more than once and it's harder every time. <br />You'll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was broken. <br />You'll fight with your best friend. <br />You'll blame a new love for things an old one did. <br />You'll cry because time is passing too fast, you'll eventually lose someone you love. <br /><br />So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you've<br />never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute<br />of happiness you'll never get back. <br /><br />Don't be afraid that your life will end, be afraid that it will never begin.
