https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/04/relaxing.html \-\-- Well i\`m
not actually. I\`m laid here in the bath with Zara doing DIY!\
\
And I mean DIY in the bathroom renovation kind of way.\
\
This is going to be the most perfect bathroom ever. Or at least it would
be if Zara wasn\`t saying \'oh, i\`m not happy with that\'\' -out come
the -whatever is needed to put it right- and she\`s off again.\
\
As long as the bath water is hot and the neighbours can\`t see me then
i\`ll be happy with this bathroom,\
\
Ok, the cats are here now. Garfield wants the sink tap on so he can have
a drink.\
\
Sigh, it must be nice to relax in the peace and quiet after a hard days
work. I shouldn\`t complain too much. Zara is working damned hard on
this bathroom. So i\`m not. Complaining that is.\
\
And whilst I remember I shall introduce my newest tenant [3rd Times a
Charm](https://stumblingthroughlifewithgrace.com/index.php) who has
promised to be a model tenant and not leave pizza boxes everywhere.
