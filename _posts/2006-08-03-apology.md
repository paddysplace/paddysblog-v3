For yestrerdays post?\
Yeah, right.\
I have my principles.\
\
Anyway. Enough of the hate.\
\
No. The apology goes to Garfield. Or in my case a double apology.\
It was his 2nd birthday at the weekend.\
And we forgot. Not only that but then I forgot to post some pictures of
him on his new scratching post. So.\
\
Sorry\
Sorry\
\
So here he is. Happy Belated Birthday G-Man.\

Although he does also owe me an apology for perforating me with his claw
as I walked past him.\
\
He was high on catnip at the time so I guess I can let him off with a
warning.\

[Deckchair trapped testicles]{style="font-weight:bold;"}\
\
A Croatian man got a nasty surprise when he tried to get out of his deck
chair and found his testicles had got stuck.\
\
Mario Visnjic had gone swimming naked in the sea at the Valalta beach in
western Croatia, reports 24sata.\
\
His testicles had shrunk while in the cool sea and slipped through the
wooden slats when he sat back down on his wooden deckchair.\
\
But as he lay in the sun they expanded back to normal size and got stuck
between the slats.\
\
He was eventually freed after he called beach maintenance services on
his mobile phone and they sent a member of staff to cut the deck chair
in half.
