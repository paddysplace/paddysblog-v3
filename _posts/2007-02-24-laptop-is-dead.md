live the laptop.\
\
It was the best of times it was the worst of times. I loved my clunky,
noisy, slow ugly beast of a laptop. But on Monday 19 February 2007 at
7:35am all was silent.\
\
A quick trip to the Dell website..and..\
\
As of Friday 23 February 2007 at 4:45pm the world was a happy place
again, and Zara could breath a sigh of relief that my days of going cold
turkey were over.\
\
So now, sat quietly and gently warming my legs is a sleak, shiny, quiet,
fast Dell Inspiron. With a (unusually for me) legal copy of Windows all
singing all dancing Vista. And so far i\'m more than bloody happy with
it.\
\
And it\'s got a cool chess game too.\
\
So does this mean i\'ll be blogging more?\
\
I doubt it. But when I do be happy in the knowledge that these words
have been written quickly, smoothly and quietly.\
\
Well they will be as soon as I get used to this new keyboard.
