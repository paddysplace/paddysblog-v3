Ok, feeling mellow. Chilled out. Relaxed. <br />Downright sleepy infact!<br /><br />So this will be more of a mumble than a coherent post (so what`s new I hear you cry!)<br /><br />I have nothing to whinge about, no rant about work. Life is peachy. <br /><br />Due to the fact i`ve only just learnt that NTL have dropped the 3Gb a month cap on upload/downloads i`ve been adding pictures and videos like mad.<br /><br />So anyone who is interested. And didn`t get an invite email off me here are the pages for my pics and vids.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/Paddy">Daily Motion videos</a><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paddeespics/">Flickr Pics</a><br /><br />Again, all work is excellently produced by Zara and uploaded by yours truly. I`m a sucker for signing up on sites so if you know of anything similar or better I can add my already overworked email address to then let me know.<br /><br />Sigh, so that`s it really. I think i`m just too tired to post anything interesting. Or maybe i`ve just had a dull day.<br /><br />Maybe I should wait to be tagged so I can answer some indepth questions ;)
