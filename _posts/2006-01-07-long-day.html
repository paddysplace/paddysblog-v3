Well i`m just waiting for my bath to finish running then i`m off for a relaxing soak and listen to the <a href="http://www.miketechshow.com/">Mike Tech Show</a> for some good ol` geeky podcast fun.<br /><br />Made a tentative start to demolish the bathroom for our new suite, which we bought today. Put AVG on my dad`s computer (and instantly found a Trojan...yeah, thanks Norton AV!) and just finished watching Madagascar.<br /><br />So a busy day. Managed to stay calm, relaxed and reasonably stress free so nothing to rant about. In short...i`m feeling mellow.<br /><br />Although this Belgian beer i`m drinking is helping.<br /><br />So I shall introduce my first blogspace rentee. <a href="http://www.beanheadbabbles.blogspot.com/">Beanhead</a>, who I picked for having some decent taste in music and films (i.e. Saving Private Ryan, and Guns n Roses) and has the coolest Blog title pic i`ve seen so far. Ahem, other than <a href="http://www.jmw500.blogspot.com/">gemmak`s</a> of course!<br /><br />So now dear reader I shall depart and continue this mellowness in a nice hot bath.
