In honour of our 4 little furry friends who have been running rings around us and caused us to move the bookcase away from the wall to retrieve one little furry rodent who refused to go to bed.<br /><br />Here...is a rat cake.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0319Image0017.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0319Image0017.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0319Image0011.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0319Image0011.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />No, not a cake made out of rats. Although if the little beasts carry on as they are...<br /><br />..ahem, anyway. The photo in the 2nd pic is of the rats my parents had at the time.
