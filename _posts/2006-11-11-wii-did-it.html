The end of another funny day.<br /><br />A day of fun, laughter, arguing and stony silence.<br /><br />Life would be so boring if it was any other way.<br /><br />Finally gotten round to pre-ordering our Wii.<br /><br />Now it's just the long wait until 8th December, and then hope we're in the first batch to be sent out.<br /><br />I'm no good at waiting.
