Don`t know if it was in any of the papers as I don`t read them! But I had to try not to laugh out loud at the irony of what this guy was trying to say. Do you think he has ANY idea.<br /><br />Bearing in mind that this placard was waved in a country that allows freedom of speech. I`m sorry. But am I missing something here? <br /><br />Caricatures of their prophet is a no no.<br />But burning caricatures of our leaders and calling for their deaths is ok?<br /><br />Another story I caught over the weekend that had me shaking my head was titled:<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />Dog owners in China opt to have canines' vocal cords cut to keep them quiet</span><br /><br />It`s the shortest 'article' i`ve ever but the two lines that made up the article left  feeling there is not help for humanities stupidity.<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><br />In order to stop their pets from barking, many unlicensed owners in one Chinese city are opting to have their dogs' vocal cords cut.</span><br /><br />Hmm, I never will understand people.
