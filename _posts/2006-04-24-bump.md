\-\-- Ok, it\`s official.\
\
I can\`t do DIY. Well that\`s not entirely true. I can do it up to a
point.\
\
And that point happens to be putting cupboards up.\
\
And yesterday that point came crashing down. Fortunately my head broke
its fall.\
\
Was it the wall plugs? was it the screws? who knows. But down it came.
So now I have a nice lump on the top of my head. But I wasn\`t going to
be defeated by Ikeas finest chipboard.\
\
Cupboard 1 went up, and stayed. Cupboard 2 went up\...and has also yet
to make a bid for freedom from the wall. It looks pretty good. Would
look even better if the door fram the cupboard is hanging above was
level. But I\`ve finally convinced myself\...with help from Zara that
there\`s nothing I can do about that.\
\
So now i\`m starting to hate DIY.\
I was never that keen on it in the first place.\
\
There is a reason people set up as painters and decorators.\
\
And i\`m beginning to realise that reason is me.
