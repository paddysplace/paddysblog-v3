Well as I lay here in the bath...hmm, maybe I should do a sunday bath post. Anyway, as I lay here Garfield is destroying the upstairs hallway. My girlfriend is clearing out the spare room so there are bags n boxes everywhere which are obviously hiding god knows what according to Garfields imagination.<br /><br />And what is it with cats and closed doors...they`re just meant to be open I guess! I had the bathroom door closed earlier, which is a big no no according to Miaow. And she is quiet persistant about this. The door wasn`t closed fully so it was on the latch, but enough so it was wedged in the door frame. I`m sure she was taking run ups and basically just headbutting it until it opened! <br /><br />Anyway, pleased with her moments work of opening another door she looked at me, smiled...I swear she smiled! miaowed at me and walked off. <br /><br />In search of other doors no doubt.
