With all the sadness and trauma going on in the world at the moment, it is worth reflecting on the death of a very important person, which almost went unnoticed last week. <br /><br />Larry LaPrise, the man that wrote "The Hokey Cokey" died peacefully at the age of 93. The most traumatic part for his family was getting him into the coffin.<br /><br />They put his left leg in. <br /><br />And then the trouble started.<br /><br />...laugh damnit people..it's only a joke.
