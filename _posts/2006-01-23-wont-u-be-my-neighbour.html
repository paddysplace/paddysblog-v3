Ok, so I nicked a line from an Ugly Kid Joe song for my title. It`s hard thinking of new titles damnit!<br /><br />Anyway, introducing my new tenant Stacie from <a href="http://www.mommysbusytakeanumber.com/">Mommy`s busy, take a number</a>. I actually had quite a few bidders to be my tenant this week. Maybe i`m getting more popular, heh.<br /><br />I think what really tipped it in her favour was the fact she has more animals than us (and children, although we don`t have any so not sure if that counts!). Also her site is pretty much all pink which will piss Zara off, which is another point in her favour, heh.<br /><br />Well my mind is a blank tonight. I`m sure there was stuff I wanted to say but I think it`s gone and dribbled out my ears. <br /><br />Don`t you just hate it when that happens.
