I`ve been awake 45 minutes now!<br /><br />Of course my workmates hammering at the door wanting my van keys kinda helped! <br />And the cat jumping off the bed growling.<br />And my girlfriend making me get out of bed and answer the door..<br />..unfortunately I picked up her bright green dressing gown to go answer the door in.<br /><br />Not looking forward to work on Monday now!!<br /><br />So now here I sit. Wide awake.
