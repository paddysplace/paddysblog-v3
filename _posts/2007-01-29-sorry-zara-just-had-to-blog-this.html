Beware, this sounds bad.<br /> <br />I'm not usually one for posting warnings about scams but I had a near miss the other day.<br />I walked into B&Q for my 'daily' visit and some old guy, dressed all in orange, asked me if I wanted decking.<br /><br />Fortunately, I got the first punch in and that was the end of that.<br /><br />Those less suspecting might not be so lucky - be on your guard.
