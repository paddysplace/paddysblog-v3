\-\-- Well the obviously very mature 26 year old has thrown his toys out
his pram and gone stomping off into the sunset.\
\
After a week of his fuck ups he got a verbal warning which had him
crying to his girlfriend. And after he was burped and put to bed early
he came in today to face us like a man.\
\
Then scribbled his resignation on a scrap of paper. And went.\
\
And whilst I was at home on my dinner break, damnit.\
\
Sigh I miss all the fun.\
\
No doubt that won\'t be the last we hear of him. He\'s the sort to cause
trouble and will probably cry that he was treated unfairly. Yeah, so, we
hated the twat. No need to take is so personally eh.\
\
That\'s what happens when you refuse to take responsibility for your own
actions.\
\
I\'m tempted to post his myspace.com profile link on here. But he\'s not
worth the hassle really if he ever found out. Well, we\'ll see. Depends
on how much he pisses us off.\
\
Which will be nothing compared to the broken legs he\'ll have if certain
people catch up with him. So it\'ll not be like he\'ll be running after
me.\
\
Ooh, this is turning nasty. I\'m tired. He walked out leaving us well
and truly in the shit at work.\
\
Yeah, nice on muppet.
