weekly posts now!\
There isn\'t enough me to go round. Which sounds kinda big headed. I
mean there isn\'t enough time to fit all of me in. I never seem to get
the things I want done. Or have the time to get them done in.\
\
Upload pictures, upload video. Set the spare pc up as a file
server\....again. Play Zelda on the Wii. Talk to friends online who
never seem to be online anymore goddamit where are you people. Blog
more! Oh, and other stuff I can\'t really think of right now damn my
brain.\
\
The only time I seem to get to myself is the hour (or two) I have in the
bath. And then i\'m too relaxed to blog or anything. I need another
me\...or a Mii, heh. One to do all the stuff that needs to be done and
on to go off quietly and do the stuff I\'d really like to get done.\
\
Well at least i\'ve got a blog post in.
