\-\-- Hmm, so how does one become a blog of note? Can\`t ever imagine my
mundane ramblings would come even close. Just started reading [Bored
Housewif](https://boredhousewife.blogspot.com/)e\`s blog as she seems to
have hit the bigtime. I think \'braless tuesday\' helps ;) Maybe I
should try pantless thursday or something, although I fear any readers I
do have would be totally scared away. Anyway, check out her blog \`cos
it\`s pretty funny stuff.\
\
I\`ve been randomly hitting other peoples blogs by way of the \'next
blog\' button. The results tend to range from the normal/mundane (i.e.
like mine) to the beyond weird. The amount of porn blogs is astounding.
Do people actually read them (not that I did of course!). It\`s either
that or foreign language blogs. It\`s fun for a few minutes to see what
blogs are out there. And kinda warm n fuzzy making to find that mine are
actually better than a few! (in my opinion).
