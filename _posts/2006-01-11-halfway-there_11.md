Ok, only 2 more days to go and i\`ll have survived my first week back.
Or, more to the point. My boss will have survived the first week back.\
\
I\`m much calmer tonight. Probably because i\`m too tired to feel angry.
I can get back to worrying about lack of money, too many bills and other
things that get forgotten about over Christmas.\
\
But it\`s tv night tonight. So i\`m soaking in the bath waiting for my
tea to cook, although I can hear Ratgirl (gonna call her that until she
tells me it\`s ok to keep using her real name and so I don\`t have to
keep typing \'my girlfriend\' (phew!!)) on the phone so it\`ll probably
be a mad rush to get tea cooked before Stargare Atlantis starts. Then
it\`s Threshold, then it\`s the finale of Lost.\
\
Too much tv, too many channels, not enough time to watch everything in!
And I want to get into watching Battlestar Galactica!\
\
I need a video ipod so I can watch stuff at work. I\`m thinking of
adding a paypal donation button on the right hand side so all you
generous people can help me ;)
