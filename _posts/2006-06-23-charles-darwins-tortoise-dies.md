\
THE world\'s oldest animal in captivity has died on the Sunshine Coast
at the ripe old age of 176.\
Giant Galapagos tortoise Harriet has died of a suspected heart attack.\
\
She was a star attraction at Steve Irwin\'s Australia Zoo since the
1980s and even features in the Guinness Book of Records for her
longevity.\
\
Her history is as colourful as the hibiscus flowers she lovingly munched
on.\
\
It is believed Harriet was one of three animals naturalist Charles
Darwin brought back from his trip to the Galapagos Islands in 1835 and
which led to his theories of evolution and natural selection.\
\
A few years later, Sir Charles gave them to a Brisbane-bound friend.\
\
For about 100 years Harriet was mistakenly thought to be a male.\
\
At 176, Harriet was recognised as the world\'s oldest living chelonian -
a reptile with a shell or bony plates.\
\
Mr Irwin said he considered Harriet a member of the family.\
\
\"Harriet has been a huge chunk of the Irwin family\'s life,\" he said.\
\
\"I have grown up with this gorgeous old girl and so have my kids.\
\
\"She is possibly one of the oldest living creatures on the planet and
her passing today is not only a great loss for the world but a very sad
day for my family.\
\
\"She was a grand old lady.\"\
