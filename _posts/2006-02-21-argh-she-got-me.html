Ok, i`ve been tagged by the very wonderful <a href="https://www.hazeltree.net/">Tarragon</a>. So here are the rules:<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">List seven songs you are into right now. No matter what the genre, whether they have words, or even if they’re any good, but they must be songs you’re really enjoying now. Post these instructions in your blog along with your seven songs. Then tag seven other people to see what they’re listening to.</span><br /><br />My songs of the moment are:<br />1. Wango Tango - Ted Nugent<br />2. Symphony of Destruction - Megadeth<br />3. Downbound Train - Bruce Springsteen<br />4. Ends - Everlast<br />5. The Thin Ice - Pink Floyd<br />6. Broken Heroes - Saxon<br />7. Electric Head - White Zombie<br /><br />I only have 4 peeps to sacrifice to this meme, so if anybody feels like doing it then let me know it my comments, k?<br /><br />1. <a href="https://www.jmw500.blogspot.com/">gemmak</a><br />2. <a href="https://celenaszoo.blogspot.com/">Celena</a><br />3. <a href="https://www.mystickalincense.com/blog/">mystickalincense</a><br />4. <a href="https://gabrielle.blogsome.com/">gabrielle</a><br />5.
