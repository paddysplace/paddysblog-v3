https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/08/all-bare.html \-\-- The more
astute amongst you may have noticed that my blog page looks a little
different. Being the sucker I am to try new things I moved my blog over
to the new blogger.com beta site.\
\
You can\'t do raw HTML editing just yet so some things like my haloscan
comments are missing. But the new elements you can add are really cool.
So no doubt i\'ll be playing like mad and messing my blog up big time.\

Oooh, now how should I label this post\...hmmm.
