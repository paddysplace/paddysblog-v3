In a little over a weeks time it should be my brother`s birthday. He would have been 33. <br /><br />We should be growing older disgracefully. <br />We should be painting our Warhammer 40k models in readiness for him to beat me yet again on the battlefield, his Marines against my Orks. <br />We should be having marathon Red Dwarf-fests and eating too much pizza. <br />We should have been sitting infront of the tv on a Sunday when the World Superbike season was on screaming at which ever british rider was on a Ducati to win. <br />We should be going out on a Saturday night and I watch in awe as women giggle all around him. <br />I should have been getting him hooked on Neverwinter Nights so we can dungeon quest together.<br />I should be doing my best to explain the rules to Magic the Gathering.<br /><br />But we won`t. And i`ll not do many of those things without him. I`m lost without his unending quick wit and jokes that we used to bounce off each other. Usually at the expense of my ex-wife. Not that she minded, she usually just slapped us round the head like two naughty kids.<br /><br />And that`s how we were. Despite all lifes hassles we never really grew up. Why am I writing all this now? <br /><br />I guess cos all these thoughts are bouncing around in my head. In a weeks time they might have faded into a frustrating mess inside my head. Jumbled up like the rest of my thoughts usually are.<br /><br />I`m trying to decide how to spend the day. I feel like watching all 3 lord of the rings films back to back. Just curl up on the settee with the fire on and detatch myself from real life. <br /><br />Sounds like a plan.
