\-\-- I think i\'m coming down with something.\
All the signs are there. The signs Zara had before she got ill. And has
now passed on said contagion to me.\
\
Hopefully it won\'t come to anything. I haven\'t been ill in a long
time. I was always catching colds as a kid. But as i\'ve got older (but
not necessarily grown up) i\'ve become a bit hardier to the little
beasties that try and infect me.\
\
I\'m on holiday for the next week, I can\'t decide if getting ill is
good timing or bad.\
\
Again, hopefully it won\'t come to anything.\
\
So i\'m going to have as relaxing a week as possible. Until Friday
anyway. Which probably doesn\'t mean a lot to people who don\'t read
this often. Or don\'t know me.\
\
You\'ll find out if things get too much and a sudden rush of emotion
comes out via the keyboard (read back to this time last year if you
really want to know).\
\
I\'m doing a little better this year for some reason. Up \'til now. Not
so many downs. But i\'m trying not to let things prey on my mind.\
\
A nintendo DS is wonderful for occupying your mind!\
\
My brother would have loved it :(\
\
Damn, there I go. First crack in the armour.
