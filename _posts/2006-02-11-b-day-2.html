All the old tiles are off. Including most of the plaster! Zara had great fun with expanding foam. She just has to wait 6 hours to get the damn stuff off her hands before she can do anything again.<br /><br />I, of course, was in a terrible mood doing all of this. I`m just not a DIY`er. I hate it. It`s probably because i`m no good at it. I don`t know what i`m doing. So Zara`s mum and Rod are coming up tomorrow night to help over the next week.<br /><br />I`ve got Monday off, and i`m thinking of spending the day in the pub. <br /><br />Despite all these little hiccups we`re ready to go. The suite is in the garage, along with the tiles, tile adhesive. Wallpaper, floor tiles and a large bottle of whisky.<br /><br />Of course now we just have to hope we can get into the bathroom tomorrow after Zara`s mad expanding foam frenzy!
