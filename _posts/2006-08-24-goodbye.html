This will be my last post for some time. This will come as a shock to some of you, but I have made the monumental decision to take off for the rest of the year. <br /><br />There are a number of reasons, but the major contributor to my decision has been my involvement with a guerrilla group in Venezuela, which is fighting for freedom and justice against unbelievable odds. <br /><br />I have been in contact with this group for a number of years by email, and now will finally join them. I know most of you will think I am totally crazy - - but I have not made This decision lightly. <br /><br />Nothing you can say or do will stop me from doing what I truly believe in. I realize the timing is terrible and my family will suffer - - but I hope to see you again in happier days -when I return from my mission!<br /><br /><br />PHOTO OF REBEL GROUP ATTACHED.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/2320/2148/1600/group.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/2320/2148/320/group.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
