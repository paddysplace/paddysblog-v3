Exhausted. Long day. Flights went smoothly and we arrived at JFK ahead
of time. Very nervous getting through passport control but the airbus
and shuttle journey didn't take long at all. It's 8:20pm now but my
body is telling me it has gone midnight. 'early' night tonight.

Edit: hopefully changed the time settings for this blog to show local
time.
