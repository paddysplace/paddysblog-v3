\-\-- Bank Holiday Monday 2003.\
Loughborough.\
Me and Zara meet for the first time.\
\
Three years later and we\'re (hopefully) still as happy as the first
time we met. Although I\'m sure she\'ll tell you something a little more
colourful.\
\
It\'s amazing the things you find on the internet.\
\
After my marriage broke down, up or whichever direction it goes in. I
thought i\'d never want to live with anybody else again. I was happy
playing the field.\
\
And as with most fields, they have their good parts and their bad, some
dry places, and some places crawling with strange little creatures. But
in the field was also a beautiful flower that just attracted me from the
moment I saw it.\
\
Unfortunately Zara stamped all over it and had stood in it\'s place by
the time I got to it.\
\
Ok, ok, i\'m joking. Yes, the flower was Zara. But that little paragraph
was getting a little too Mills n Boony.\
\
As as someone who likes a whole lotta time to himself I think Zara
deserves a medal for putting up with me for the past 3 years. Although I
can say the same also ;)\
\
So how did we spend this most romantic of days?\
\
Buying a network card for the spare pc and struggling to get the miriad
of cables under control behind the tv in an attempt to thwart small
rodent teeth from reducing a very nice widescreen tv to a box full of
bits.\
\
Oh, Zara did also get a nice new digital camera, so everything is
getting photographed at 5.1 Megapixels and at 10x zoom.\
\
I got a coaster with a rat picture on it. But it keeps my computer table
clean and looks nice.\
\
So I like it.\
\
Happy Anniversary honey.\
\
I love you.
