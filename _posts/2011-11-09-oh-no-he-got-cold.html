After our first late seeing a Broadway musical, I was still wide awake this morning at 6:30! <br /><br />It's now 8am here, I'm lying in bed and  the lump way on the other side just stirred and said. " I've got a cold!"<br /><br />So I'm thinking I'm going to have a grumpy Patrick for the last few days!!<br /><br />Hopefully it won't stop me enjoying the sights. <br />Off downtown today, once he finally gets up!
