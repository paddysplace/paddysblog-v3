Ok, not quite what your pervy little minds were thinking...hmm, or maybe thats just me.<br /><br />The new bathroom suite turned up this morning!...woo. At 9am. Which is way too early for a Saturday.<br /><br />So after a moment of panic as I tried to get my trousers on so I could move the car out the way the new suite was placed in it`s temporary home that is the garage. And now we just wait for Zara`s Mum and Rod to come up and help fit it all in for us as I don`t have the first clue about these things and would end up flooding the house....<br /><br />...and next door as well probably!<br /><br />Had a better day emotionally after the shocking news yesterday. Amazing how these feelings come and go. Live waves really. I must be in a calm patch at the moment as I feel quite mellow. Although the can of Boddingtons I had has helped I think.<br /><br />I really let loose in yesterdays post. Wrote stuff down that I haven`t written before. Feel better for letting it out though. Just hope I didn`t freak anybody out with it.<br /><br />A big thank you to Gemmak for being my willing accomplace, heh...just have to hope it dosn`t come back to bite me on the arse now! And why are you never on Messenger? hmm? hmm?<br /><br />Ok, i`ve done whinging now. I`m sure there was more I was going to say but my brain is a bit sleepy.
