Can't believe it's been nearly a week since my last post.<br />And I hope my reader(s) haven't been feeling neglected, but I can't say i've missed blogging.<br /><br />It's just laziness. I'm out of the groove. I get settled in the bath ready to write another rant and then think, ahh, this is nice and warm. Relax.<br /><br />And all the anger just washes away. <br /><br />My hand hurts though.<br /><br />I punched the shed door in a moment of frustration. I can't say i've been feeling particularly calm this last week or so. No one thing is to blame. Jut life I guess. Money. The usual things.<br /><br />Living with a stubborn head strong, yet slightly indecisive  girl doesn't help. Joking honey ;)<br /><br />So i'm finally uploading the videos of us playing the wii over Christmas. It's still January so I think it still falls under the festive season umbrella. I'll blog them as soon as they're uploaded.<br /><br />Which might be sometime in February going by my track record.<br /><br />So there you go. After a week waiting for me to say something deep and meaningful you get a few lines of waffle.<br /><br />Meh, Life eh.
