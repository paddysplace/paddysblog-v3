\-\-- ..wall left to demolish that is.\
\
Miss me?\
\
Didn\`t think so\...humph. I felt \'funny\' not posting yesterday.\
\
So, back to the wall. Been thumping lumps out the walls again. Both of
us. Without arguing! Whodda thunked it!\
\
Anyway, it\`s going well so far. The ripping out is the easy bit tho I
think. But that\`s my bit. The technical bit is for others to get
headaches over, heh.\
\
Between that and trying to get Linux running on my backup PC for no
other reason than because I want to\...i\`m sure i\`ll do a geeky tech
rant over this sometime this week. Got Mandriva running on the laptop.
Just need to get the wireless connection working on it now.\
\
Sigh.\
\
Why do I try these things.
