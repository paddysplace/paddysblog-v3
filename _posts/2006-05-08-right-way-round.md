think my head is the right way round now.\
It must be as I don\`t feel dizzy anymore. Doesn\`t mean I\`m any less
waffy. Just that I can at least see straight in my waffyness.\
It really is the most horrible feeling in the world. Well, to me it is
anyway. I\`m sure there are worse feelings but as I haven\`t experienced
any then I can only say that THIS is the most horrible feeling in the
world.\
\
To get an idea. Next time you get a killer headache spin round n round
on the spot for a minute whilst wearing some glasses that make your
vision go blurry and thats pretty much how it feels. Except it can last
for hours.\
\
Fortunately it only lasted a minute or so this time. But it can take
hours/days until I feel 100% again.\
Which I do now.\
Which Zara can attest to as i\`ve been my usual annoying self.\
\
Other than that it\`s been a typical monday. The weather was fine after
it chucked it down all day yesterday. Work was it\`s usual chaotic self,
although I managed to detach myself from it and get on with my own work.
No such luck tomorrow.\
\
Ok, enough Monday grumbles.
