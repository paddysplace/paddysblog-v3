Sigh, sod being a surrogate parent, or a halfway house...or whatever you want to call us. I just couldn`t do it.<br /><br />We looked after a friends new guinea pig from last Wednesday to Sunday. It`s was her lad`s birthday and little piggy was the present he`s been wanting for a long time. So we did the decent thing and did our best to hold lil piggy hostage, lol.<br /><br />Ok, not really...but it tempting.<br /><br />She may not have done much. She may have only sat in her cage as quietly as possible. But it feels a little emptier in the house now.<br /><br />And as can be seen <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/Paddy/video/52741">here </a>she takes an instant like to Sooty our rat!<br /><br />We need more pets...the house is too empty with only ourselves 2 cats and a rat.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0218Image0044.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0218Image0044.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
