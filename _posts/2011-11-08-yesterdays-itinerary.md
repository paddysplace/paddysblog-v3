Hi, after reading Paddys post from yesterday, that it was a
'busy' day. Thought I'd go into a little more detail onto why it was
busy!

Up at 6, leave hotel 7, car back at 7:30, walk to train station by 7:45,
train to new York 8:17, grand central 10:10, subway to hotel with 3
changes arrived 10:50, out at 11:10 to get subway again to pier 83
circle line cruises, arrived 12:10, cruise left 12:30, all round
manhattan island, 800 photos later arrived back at 3:30, grabbed
slice(size of whole one!) of pizza at bakery 4:00, walked to times sq
then along broadway to empire state building arrived 5:30, went up
empire state 86 floors, legs turned to jelly! Short walk then subway
back to our hotel, arrived to our room at 7:55pm! It felt like 1 in the
morning!

Needless to say we slept well and ready for another jam packed day!
