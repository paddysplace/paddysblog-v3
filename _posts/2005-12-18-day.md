\-\-- I\`m sat here feeling kinda detatched from the world.\
I think it\`s the deer in the water, helpless as their surroundings are
consumed.\
\
It\`s like a switch has been flipped inside me.\
\
I\`ve been sat here trying to think how to spend the day. Yesterday I
was feeling fine. I build today up so much I end up not knowing how to
get through it.\

So I surfed the web a bit, checked ebay for last minute gifts, read my
bloglines rss feeds. And came across this pic from a website. I don\`t
know why, but it seems to sum up how I feel at the minute.\
\
My stomach knots up and I feel a lump in my throat as I look at the
deer. Wishing I could help them, feeling their fear. I empathise far too
much.\

Happy Birthday David.\
\
I miss you.
