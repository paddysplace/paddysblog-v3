Ah, Easter. <br /><br />That wonderful religious time of the year.<br /><br />If you`re a Christian: The God who created this universe sent His Son to die on a cross in order to save us from our sins and give us eternal life.<br /><br />If you`re Pagan: originally the name of pagan vernal festival . . . Eastre, dawn goddess. <span style="font-style:italic;">Or something like that. I was trying to find a shortened version, but without pasting reams n reams of info then this is all you`re gonna get</span><br /><br />Or if you`re me: Then it`s a 4 day weekend!..woohoo.<br /><br />I`ve had a nice quiet morning as Zara had to work <span style="font-weight:bold;">*insert evil laugh here*</span>. Although that should end any moment now as she and my mum come over to do the wallpapering of the bathroom.<br /><br />So until them i`m sat here in the computer room on the sofa having a completely geeky moment with my laptop on my knee,  my videocasts playing on my pc through itunes. And my ipod strapped to my side. Ahh, so many security blankets!<br /><br />Zara left me a list of chores to do this morning which I can proudly report I have all done. So hopefully I won`t get told off when she gets in ;)<br /><br />T`was a bit strange getting to lay in bed whilst she ran around getting ready for work. But strange in a nice way, heh.<br /><br />And impatiently sat watching my counter edge closer n closer to the magic 1000 visitor mark. I have no idea why. But is seems like a bit of a milestone.
