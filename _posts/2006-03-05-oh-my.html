God, I ache. My aches aches. Aches are aching my ache aches...ache...well, you get the idea.<br /><br />I`m off back to work for a rest. This foreman I have to live with is a slave driver ;)<br /><br />Been doing Tim 'the toolman' Taylor type stuff today. Got to be all manly and mess about with big bits of plasterboard and powertools.<br /><br />And I must say i`m quite pleased with my days work. Although it did take me 3 hours to get the first board up! Even managed to put a few tiles up. Well, about 4 actually. But it`s progress.<br /><br />So now I ache. <br /><br />And I have very little to say. My day has been filled with sawing and drilling and sticking and nailing. And getting cut by the most evil tape measure i`ve ever used.<br /><br />Thanks to Lucy for inviting me to use <a href="https://www.blogmad.net/">BlogMad</a>. And in the spirit of generosity if anybody else feels like signing up leave me a comment with your email addy and i`ll send you an invite.<br /><br />But just remember me when it gets round to my birthday, heh. Hmm, maybe I should put an amazon wishlist up ;)<br /><br />Well, it`s worth a shot.<br /><br />Happy Birthday to <a href="https://celenaszoo.blogspot.com/">Celena</a>. <br /><br />Ok, my brain is falling asleep now. Time to rest
