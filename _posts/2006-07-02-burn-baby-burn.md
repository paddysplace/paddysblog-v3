what a day. I ache, i\'m tired, my head hurts from all the noise, my
eyes sting from all the bike fumes.\
But damn it was good. Well worth the money.\
\
Oh, and it was hot. Very hot. As you can see.\

\
This is me. Now. As I type this. Cooling my aching muscles in the bath.\
\
The racing was good. Even though none of our fave riders did much good.
Zara couldn\'t believe how loud they all were. We tried to get some
pictures and video of the action. But it wasn\'t easy with the number of
people there.\
\
We set the vcr to tape the action. So now we can try and spot ourselves
walking round.\
\
Ok, enough for now. Laptop battery nearly dead.\
I know how it feels!!
