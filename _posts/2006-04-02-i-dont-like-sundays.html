What a day!<br /><br />It`s been up and it`s been down. Then it was up again.<br /><br />Feeling quite dizzy from it all.<br /><br />It was bathroom day. Yes, we`re still doing that! Just a bit more decorating then it`s done. But anyway. We got a shiny new pull switch `cos Zara wanted and shiny new one. So being the careful soul I am. And not wanting to electrocute myself; I turned the power off and got busy taking the old one down.<br /><br />After a lot of swearing, grunting and sweating, no we hadn`t stopped to have sex!, the shiny new light switch was fitted. Electricity was switched on. Things switched on in a cocophany of pings, clicks, whirrs and beeps. All except my poor scanner. And. More importantly. My wireless access point.<br /><br />After more swearing, grunting and sweating. I came to the conclusion that the access point was dead.<br /><br />Passed on!<br />no more!<br />ceased to be!<br />expired and gone to meet 'is maker!<br />Bereft of life, <br />rests in peace! <br />kicked the bucket<br />shuffled off 'is mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisibile!!<br /><br />It is an ex access point!<br /><br />Ok, so twisting a few Monty Python lines was a little extreme. But you get my point.<br /><br />I was stressed. I was past the point of stressed. So how was I to deal with this hightened level of stressfulness?<br /><br />DIY.<br /><br />Yeah, that would help.<br /><br />But funnily enough it did. So we spent the rest of the afternoon, and half the night sticking up polystyrene tiles on the ceiling.<br /><br />It`s not the best ceiling tiling ever done. But it`s ours.<br /><br />Afterwards food was eaten, tv was watched and I relaxed in a nice hot bath and gazed at out wonderful ceiling. Had to do something. Couldn`t get on the damn internet from my laptop!<br /><br />And then. I hit ebay.<br /><br />A Belkin access point the same as my expired one was on ebay. I`d been watching it all day. And with less than a minute to go I stuck a high bid in and won it for £16.00!<br /><br />Yay me.<br /><br />So now i`m happy again. Or at least I will be when it turns up.<br /><br />I think Zara was going to move out until I had my laptop sorted. I don`t know what she means by that.<br /><br />I usually take these setbacks quite calmly ;)
