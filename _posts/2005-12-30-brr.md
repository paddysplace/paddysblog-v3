\-\-- Well, another day and hopefully a better mood.\
\
We\`re meant to be travelling down to Oxford to stay with my
girlfriend\`s family. Although looking at the weather I don\`t know how
likely that is.\
\
But if we go then I won\`t be able to wish everyone a Happy New Year so
i\`ll do it now.\

[HAPPY NEW YEAR]{style="font-weight:bold;"}
