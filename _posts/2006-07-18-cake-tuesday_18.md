Zara has been cake making like mad recently as the company she works for
is trying to get into the celebration cake market using her fantastic
skills.\
\
These are a few designs she \'whipped up\' in a few hours just to give
[The Windmill](https://www.trueloafbakery.co.uk/) an idea of what can be
done quickly. The idea being that each model takes Zara no more then 30
mins!\

\
How she does them in 30mins is beyond me!\
\
Each \'cake\' is actually a dummy. Made up of a polystyrene block and
covered with icing.\

\
She\'s made 12 dummy cake designs in all. Using 3 dummys, taking photos
of the results. Stripping the decoration off then adding new models and
words.\
\
As always, any questions leave em in the comments and the boss will
answer.
