Well I was going to rant and rave about my first day back at work after the hols. But as it`s my girlfriends birthday I shall leave the ranting until tomorrow...oh there is plenty to moan about believe me!<br /><br />Anyway, I got everything done. Presents got wrapped. Card got made, and cake got baked and decorated...kinda!<br /><br />All under the expert and stressed supervision of my nearest and dearest. As a cake decorator by trade she took me under her wing, and didn`t shout at me too much, heh.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/DSCF0524.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/DSCF0524.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Anyway, here is my effort.
