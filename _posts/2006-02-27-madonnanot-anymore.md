Ok, just had to make a quick mention on this story I read on The
Superficial:\
\
[Madonna has gotten a pair of fake eyelashes made from mink and studded
with diamonds from Japanese makeup artist Shu Uemura. The Scoop alleges
that the mink is real but they\'re not sure about the diamonds. I\'ll
just go ahead and assume the diamonds are real as
well]{style="font-style:italic;"}\...[[more]{style="font-style:italic;"}](https://www.thesuperficial.com/archives/2006/02/27/madonna_has_fake_eyelashes_1.html)\
\
The original story is from a snippet on MSNBC.\
\
Mink eyelashes\...eyelashes made from real mink?\...all I can say is
WHAT THE FUCK\...
