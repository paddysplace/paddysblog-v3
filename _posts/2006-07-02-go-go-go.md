\
I\'m ready to go.\
It\'s like Christmas when I was a kid. Hell, it\'s like Christmas now!
Going to bed early. Not being able to sleep. Waking up early.\
\
Zara kept threatening to leave me at my parents yesterday and pick me up
this morning.\
I don\'t get too excited.\
\
So the weekend has been filled with watching practice and qualifying.
And now we\'re getting ready so we can be there for warm-up and the
races.\
\
Food n drink are ready, the tickets are in a place where we can\'t
forget them. The digicam and video camera batteries are fully charged.\
\
Time to go racing. Yay.
