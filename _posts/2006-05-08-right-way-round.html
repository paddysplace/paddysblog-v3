I think my head is the right way round now.<br />It must be as I don`t feel dizzy anymore. Doesn`t mean I`m any less waffy. Just that I can at least see straight in my waffyness.<br />It really is the most horrible feeling in the world. Well, to me it is anyway. I`m sure there are worse feelings but as I haven`t experienced any then I can only say that THIS is the most horrible feeling in the world.<br /><br />To get an idea. Next time you get a killer headache spin round n round on the spot for a minute whilst wearing some glasses that make your vision go blurry and thats pretty much how it feels. Except it can last for hours.<br /><br />Fortunately it only lasted a minute or so this time. But it can take hours/days until I feel 100% again. <br />Which I do now.<br />Which Zara can attest to as i`ve been my usual annoying self.<br /><br />Other than that it`s been a typical monday. The weather was fine after it chucked it down all day yesterday. Work was it`s usual chaotic self, although I managed to detach myself from it and get on with my own work. No such luck tomorrow. <br /><br />Ok, enough Monday grumbles.
