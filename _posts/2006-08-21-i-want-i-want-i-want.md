\-\-- Sigh. So many things. So little money.\
I feel Madonna\'s \'Material Girl\' should be playing in the
background.\
Or at least a blokey version of it. As i\`m not a girl. Or gay.\
\
But anyway, The point I was so badly trying to make was\...I
want\...stuff!\
\
Actually it\'s more of a need than a want. Which sounds slightly less
materialistic. Zara\'s nearly killed her digital camer through overuse.
So that\'s a need. She\'ll be a nightmare to live with if she can\'t
take her average of a dozen pics a day of the pets.\
\
None of which ever seem to make it onto Flickr. Which is my fault.\
\
And we need a multiregion, 3 in 1 dvd/hard drive/video recorder. As our
aging vcr is virtually senile. And has a hissy fit if you try and change
the video in it. Of course we could just get a new vcr. but damnit I
want to join the 21st century in tellybox recording.\
\
Or something like that.\
\
Oh, but I do want a new Ipod video. Not that i\'ve killed my ipod mini.
I just want to watch stuff on my pod at work. But then I DO need someone
in the states to record the new series of Stargate and send me the
episodes\....see, now that\'s important.\
\
Any paypal donations on offer?\
\
this is for a very good cause.
