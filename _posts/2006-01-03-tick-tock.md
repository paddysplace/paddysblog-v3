https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/01/tick-tock.html \-\-- So it\`s
nearly 2am and i\`m in bed on my own.\
\
Why?\
\
Cos my girlfriend is perfecting the calendar she\`s making for my
parents.\
She\`s like that. She has so much patience for these things it\`s
unbelievable.\
She also gets incredibly stressed doing these things. Is that possible?
to be so stressed yet have the patience to sit their and not move until
it\`s 100% to her standards.\
\
Well, i\`m not on my own anymore, Miaow has joined me.\
\
2am\...I didn\`t wake up until 10:30 this morning. I\`m usually awake at
about 8am. It\`s going to be sooo hard getting up for work next monday.\
\
I really am going to have to stop dwelling on that until at least Sunday
night.
