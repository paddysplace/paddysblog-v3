And another crappy New Year begins.\
\
I\'m full of cold. As soon as my holidays started I could feel it taking
over my system. And now it\'s set up home in my head and keeps making
banging noises and has installed cladding in the walls.\
\
Urgh.\
\
Anyway. Christmas was great despite all this. Oh, and Zara\'s wisdom
tooth made a bid for freedom and has been trying to push it\'s way up.
So she\'s not a happy bunny.\
\
Anyway, yeah. Christmas. Copious amounts of alcohol were drunk. EU food
size mountains were eaten. And cool presents exchanged. And we\'ve still
got a ton of food to get through. I think we went a little mad on the
shopping.\
\
So now I have books to read. DVD\'s to watch and Nintendo DS/PC games to
play.\
\
The Wii is way more fun than I imagined (Sorry to rub it in Carto). My
parents came round Boxing Day and we played Wii Sports until we
couldn\'t move. My mum was frighteningly good at it!\
\
Then it was down to Oxford to stay at Zara\'s Dad\'s\....\
\
\...ok, I\'ll stop typing for now.\
\
Don\'t want to make this into a novel sized post.
