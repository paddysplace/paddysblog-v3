\-\-- The worst week is nearly over.\
Just when I thought it was safe to breath a sigh of relief I get a phone
call from my mum.\
There other little rat died this morning.\
Sigh.\
So for the first time in a long time we are a rat free family.\
\
This situation won\'t last long. Zara is struggling without her little
furry friends in the house.\
The Wall where the rat house sits is devoid of life.\
And it doesn\'t feel right.\
\
We\'re not replacing Sooty.\
We haven\'t forgotten about him\
Or gotten over his death.\
\
We\'re just adding to our family again.\
\
Thanks to all you guys for the kind words. We sometimes wonder if we\'re
the only one that are passionate about animals.\
\
Personally I prefer their company to that of people most of the time.
But the odd kind word from humans doesn\'t go amiss :)
