This is quite a plane cake...hur hur<br /><br />Ahem, anyway. Planes seem to give Zara a hard time in the making. So these are pretty rare designs. Limited only to my dad it seems!<br /><br />As he loves flying it does make for an easy choice of cake for him though.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/2320/2148/1600/Plane%20cake.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/2320/2148/320/Plane%20cake.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
