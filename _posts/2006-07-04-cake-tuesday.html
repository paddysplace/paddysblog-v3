Staying with the motoring theme for this weeks Cake Tuesday.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0623Image0059.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0623Image0059.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />This is the cake Zara did for her Step Dad's 60the Birthday. It's a Triumph TR4. He intends to buy one and restore it to its former glory.<br /><br />Or something like that!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0623Image0054.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0623Image0054.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />As always.
