Well the obviously very mature 26 year old has thrown his toys out his pram and gone stomping off into the sunset.<br /><br />After a week of his fuck ups he got a verbal warning which had him crying to his girlfriend. And after he was burped and put to bed early he came in today to face us like a man.<br /><br />Then scribbled his resignation on a scrap of paper. And went.<br /><br />And whilst I was at home on my dinner break, damnit. <br /><br />Sigh I miss all the fun.<br /><br />No doubt that won't be the last we hear of him. He's the sort to cause trouble and will probably cry that he was treated unfairly. Yeah, so, we hated the twat. No need to take is so personally eh.<br /><br />That's what happens when you refuse to take responsibility for your own actions.<br /><br />I'm tempted to post his myspace.com profile link on here. But he's not worth the hassle really if he ever found out. Well, we'll see. Depends on how much he pisses us off.<br /><br />Which will be nothing compared to the broken legs he'll have if certain people catch up with him. So it'll not be like he'll be running after me.<br /><br />Ooh, this is turning nasty. I'm tired. He walked out leaving us well and truly in the shit at work.<br /><br />Yeah, nice on muppet.
