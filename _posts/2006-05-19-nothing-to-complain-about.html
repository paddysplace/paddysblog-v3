A friend emailed me this, thought i`d blog it instead of just mailing it on:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/boy.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/400/boy.png" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />This is the Pulitzer prize winning photo taken in 1994 during the Sudan famine. The picture depicts a famine stricken child crawling towards an United Nations food camp, located a kilometer away.<br /><br />No one knows what happened to the child. Including the photographer, Kevin Carter, who left the place as soon as the photograph was taken.<br /><br />Three months later he committed suicide due to depression.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/kc.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/kc.png" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />This was found in his diary ,  <br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Dear God, I promise I will never waste my food no matter how bad it can taste and how full I may be. I pray that He will protect this little boy, guide and deliver him away from his misery. I pray that we will be more sensitive towards the world around us and not be blinded by our own selfish nature and  interests.<br />I hope this picture will always serve as a reminder to us  that how fortunate we are and that we must never ever take things for granted.  </span>
