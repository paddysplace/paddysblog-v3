I`m ashamed to say i`ve been enjoying myself far too much and really couldn`t be bothered to blog anything the past few days. <br /><br />Also getting Dawn of War: Winter Assault didn`t help. Although not getting to play that nearly as much as I want.<br /><br />Damn food n drink getting in the way.<br /><br />Anyway, major snowy weather today. Garfield wasted no time going outside to test out his snow paws.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2005_1227Image0071.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2005_1227Image0071.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2005_1227Image0048.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2005_1227Image0048.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
