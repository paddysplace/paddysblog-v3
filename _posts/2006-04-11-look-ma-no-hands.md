Under pressure again.\
Gotta type fast before my laptop battery runs out.\
\
Which won\`t be easy as i\`m in the bath with the lights off so I can
barely see my keyboard. I am slightly touch type proficient ie. I can
finf the delete key really quickly!\
\
Why am I in the bath with the lights off?\
\
Well we still haven\`t finished the bathroom yet so no curtain is up at
the window and I really don\`t like the thought of my neighbour across
the road seeing me shake my thing as I get out the bath\...especially as
it\`s not even half nekkid thursday yet.\
\
So. I\`m in a happy mood. I\`m free, untethered, I have thrown off the
shackles of wired networking once more!\
\
Yes. My new wireless access point arrived today. No longer do I feel the
restrictive bondage of the cat 5 rj-45 cable.\
\
So no matter what crap life throws at me this week I shall brush it
aside knowing my laptop if free to roam the house.
