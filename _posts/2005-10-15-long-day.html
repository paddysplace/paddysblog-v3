Been to my grandparents today with my grandads birthday cake. Had a great time. Met the goose and gander, and hen that he keeps in the back garden. Got some cool pics of me being kept quiet by gander, lol. <br /><br />Went for a meal and a wander about the town, was a real nice relaxing day. Crashed out in the bath on my laptop wondering why MY legs ache after walking round town with an 80 year old!
