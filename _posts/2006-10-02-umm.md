\-\-- Well as usual i\'ve left my posting until as late as possible and
now I\'m being\...umm, what\'s the word. \'Asked\' if i\'m getting out
the bath soon.\
\
Someone is wanting to get tea started methinks.\
\
Anyhoo..my Monday has been a bit\...umm. That\'s the best way to
describe it really. Umm.\
\
Nothing really happened. Nothing wound me up. Nothing pissed me off. I
guess nobody was awake enough this Monday to cause me grief. I\'ll have
to watch the news later to see if anything happened.\
\
Maybe the rest of the world had an umm day. I\'ll switch on the tv and
find the news reporter sleeping at their desk.\
\
Ok. Now, this isn\'t a complaint, or a moan or a gripe about the lack of
comments I get. I\'m rising above all that\...for now anyway.\
\
But Zara did \'mention\' that she was unable to post a comment today.
Anybody else having problems? Anyone know how to get haloscan working in
blogger beta?\
\
Email/skype or send me and odeo message of you have anything to
say..those buttons are there on the right for a purpose people\...use
em!\
\
Well on that happy note I shall depart dear reader.\
