6 years ago today my world fell apart. Testing his motorbike on a
disused airfield David was in collision with a builders van speeding
across the airfiled.\
\
My life has never really been the same since. A part of my jigsaw of
life is missing and nothing I can do will ever replace it. He was my
best friend as well as my brother. We had so much in common. Liked the
same films, played the same pc games, rpg\`s, watched the same sports. I
miss all that. Nobody can take his place where all those things are
concerned.\
\
I thought the pain was supposed to get easier to deal with over time.
It\`s not.\
\
I miss you David.\
