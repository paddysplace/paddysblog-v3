not quite what your pervy little minds were thinking\...hmm, or maybe
thats just me.\
\
The new bathroom suite turned up this morning!\...woo. At 9am. Which is
way too early for a Saturday.\
\
So after a moment of panic as I tried to get my trousers on so I could
move the car out the way the new suite was placed in it\`s temporary
home that is the garage. And now we just wait for Zara\`s Mum and Rod to
come up and help fit it all in for us as I don\`t have the first clue
about these things and would end up flooding the house\....\
\
\...and next door as well probably!\
\
Had a better day emotionally after the shocking news yesterday. Amazing
how these feelings come and go. Live waves really. I must be in a calm
patch at the moment as I feel quite mellow. Although the can of
Boddingtons I had has helped I think.\
\
I really let loose in yesterdays post. Wrote stuff down that I haven\`t
written before. Feel better for letting it out though. Just hope I
didn\`t freak anybody out with it.\
\
A big thank you to Gemmak for being my willing accomplace, heh\...just
have to hope it dosn\`t come back to bite me on the arse now! And why
are you never on Messenger? hmm? hmm?\
\
Ok, i\`ve done whinging now. I\`m sure there was more I was going to say
but my brain is a bit sleepy.
