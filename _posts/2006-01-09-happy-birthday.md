I was going to rant and rave about my first day back at work after the
hols. But as it\`s my girlfriends birthday I shall leave the ranting
until tomorrow\...oh there is plenty to moan about believe me!\
\
Anyway, I got everything done. Presents got wrapped. Card got made, and
cake got baked and decorated\...kinda!\
\
All under the expert and stressed supervision of my nearest and dearest.
As a cake decorator by trade she took me under her wing, and didn\`t
shout at me too much, heh.\

\
Anyway, here is my effort. Ratgirl was her name on the website where we
met. Awww.\

\
And just to make her feel better (because I forget to post pics of cakes
she\`s done AND keep getting reminded of it) here is a piccy of the cake
she did for my Grandad\`s birthday last October.\
