Well it`s getting late and i`m tired so I wasn`t going to post anything tonight until Zara said 'you haven`t written anything'...'you`ve been in the bath'...'you always write something when you`re in the bath'.<br /><br />So here it is.<br /><br />My post bath post, heh.<br /><br />I guess all I can say is bathrooms! i`m sick of seeing bathrooms. Talking bathrooms. Bathroom wallpaper, bathroom tiles, bathroom flooring, bathroom accessories.<br /><br />Yes, we have started the redecorating, redesigning and anything else beginning in 're' of the bathroom.<br /><br />Spent most of yesterday with girlfriend and mother going round Ikea. My mum has never been before so it was like taking a kiddie round a toy store.<br /><br />So did we buy anything? yes...a shower curtain. <br /><br />At least it was a cheap(ish) shopping trip. Went with a list of about 30 things and ended up buying about 3. <br /><br />So today was spent going round diy stores picking out tiles and flooring and wallpaper. Decisions were made, choices were chosen. And after yo-yoing between B&Q, Homebase and Focus we found the optimum combination of tile, wallpaper and floor tile.<br /><br />So i`ve been ripping old tiles off the wall, which is great for stress relief. And as all DIY projects go it all ended in a falling out between me and Zara.<br /><br />But all is well again in Paddy Towers. One wall is tile free, I even cleaned up after my destruction. <br /><br />So now all I have to do is go through that another 3 times before we can start taking out the old bath, sink and toilet. Assuming the new suite gets delivered!<br /><br />I`m going to work tomorrow for a rest!
