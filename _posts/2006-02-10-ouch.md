\-\-- Well as Zara said I should blog this picture for posterity. And as
she probably thought I wouldn\`t then here it is. I apologise for those
with a weak constitution for the graphic nature of this image.\

Maybe I have a habit of having a tad too much hot water in my baths. I
was washing my hair when Zara took the picture if anybody is wondering
why my arse is in the air. If you are looking at the picture and
wondering such things then I suggest you go get some sort of
counselling!!
