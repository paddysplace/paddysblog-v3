Today has been a day of recovery.<br />In both mind and body.<br /><br />Which sounds kinda cool and mystical and stuff.<br />But in reality it just means I drank way too much on the works piss up last night.<br /><br />Evil Smirnoff Ice.<br /><br />But I think my self is starting to forgive me for the 7 hours I made it down copious amounts of vodka. Although the hour or so playing Wii Sports this afternoon did cause a slight setback in the recovery process.<br /><br />Anybody else reading this got their Wii's yet? no? Nobody wanna exchange Wii addresses? No? Anybody still playing Animal Crossing? And when I say anybody I mean you Carto? hmm? hmm?<br /><br />I think it's official. Me n Zara are complete Nintendo fanboys, er girls, er people. You've not lived if you haven't experienced Zara in full flow playing boxing. It's a scary sight. I fear for my safety now.<br /><br />So yeah. We're having fun. Christmas is going great so far. Life is feeling good.<br /><br />I'm a happy bunny.
