Ok, third attempt at writing this...must save to draft more often.<br /><br />Not that it`ll be full of whitty remarks. Deep insightful comments or tales of woe straight from the heart.<br /><br />Mainly cos it`s so late and my brain isn`t running at full capacity.<br /><br />Not that it ever really is.<br /><br />Anyway..back to the point. If there ever was one.<br /><br />I`m back? Miss me? Did you even notice?<br /><br />Humph.<br /><br />Well we went down to Oxford for the weekend. Zara`s sis`s birthday, former workplace re-opening, meeting of family n friends all rolled into one 2 day frenzy.<br /><br />Family was met, cats were played with, pizza was eaten, mayor`s hand was shaken and friends were..er..hugged.<br /><br />So now here I lay. In a hot bubbly bath. Hey, i`m in touch with my feminine side. Nothing wrong with bubbles.<br /><br />As I was saying, here I lay pretty much knackered. Not from the hectic weekend. Or the 180 mile journey home. So what wore me out?<br /><br />IKEA.<br /><br />IKEA. Great for browsing. A nightmare if you want to actually buy anything.<br /><br />I wasn`t in the best of moods to be traipsing round the place. Not that I don`t like it but I really wanted to get home.<br /><br />Well bathroom cabinets were eventually found. With hinges to fit, and the doors we liked. So we left the place a couple of happy bunnies and several pounds (the monetary kind) lighter.<br /><br />And now to bed.<br /><br />My brain is nearly at a standstill and the chance of any more coherent sentences are rapidly diminishing.<br /><br />So I shall wish you all a goodnight.<br /><br />Goodnight.
