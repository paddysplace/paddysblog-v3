right. See. New tenant. Now go visit as she\'s only here for the week.\
\
Despite the worrying blog name. I\'m sure no kittys actually get stir
fried. And the fact she has more blogs on the go than can possibly be
healthy for you; she seems to be quite a nice tenant.\
\
I\'m usually quite hopeless at giving a shoutout to my tenants so
hopefully you\'ll put some traffic her way.\
\
Now i\'ve got my chores out the way I can relax after a hard day (2
hours) stressful DIY. Pictures to follow!
