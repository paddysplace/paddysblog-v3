https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2005/10/muppet.html \-\-- Well found
out the problem with logging into my blog with \'hello\'. Was trying to
type the wrong damn username in, sigh. Must try these things when i\`m
more awake.\
\
Anyway, sat here on the laptop as i\`m backing up my main pc cos the
hard drive is whining.and i don\`t wanna lose all my mp3\`s.\
