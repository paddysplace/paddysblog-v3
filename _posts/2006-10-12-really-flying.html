Wow, where has this week gone!<br /><br />Can't believe it's Thursday all ready. My nice relaxing week is nearly over.<br />Sigh.<br />Then back to the cruddy, boring normality of work.<br /><br />Haven't posted all week, which I know will not please some people. And this one is going to be a bit short as i'm pretty tired.<br /><br />Had a great day today. Me n Zara went flying with my dad.<br />Video was taken, photo's were shot.<br /><br />I'll try n post a couple of the good ones.<br />Had a go at the controls, and managed to keep us in the blue bit and avoid hitting the green bit.<br /><br />Hence my ability to post here.<br /><br />Tomorrow should be fun as I have to try and control Zara and my mum in a HobbyCraft center.<br /><br />I think flying the plane will turn out to be easier.
