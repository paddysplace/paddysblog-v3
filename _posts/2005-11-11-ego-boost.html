Met a customer and was shaken by the hand because he liked what I did so much. Which was a relief as it was the worst design in the world to try and copy. <br /><br />And then within a few minutes of that I was complimented on another design i`d done for a different customer. Could get used to all this adoration for my work. A payrise and a few tips would be nice as well though.<br /><br />Well <a href="https://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teampage&teamnum=47308">Team Paddy</a> is up and running on the <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/folding/">folding@home</a>website. So far my team consists of me, my girlfriend and my mum. It`s turning quite competative as my mum seems to have the edge on us!<br /><br />The tragic part is I upgraded their computers and now I have the slowest computer in the family!
