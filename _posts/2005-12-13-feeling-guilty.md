https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2005/12/feeling-guilty.html \-\-- Well
i\`m feeling kinda bad. We sold a ton of lego on ebay and made a pile of
money. But as I work all day I had to leave my girlfriend to package up
all the items. Which most of the time isn\`t a problem.\
\
But we had a lot of Lego\...a LOT.\
\
She did a fantastic job. But she gets stressed easily. Which gets me
stressed cos I think she blames me for the way things go wrong when she
is stressed. Or something like that.\
\
So I get all arsey.\
\
But I really do appreciate everything she does.\
\
I guess i\`m writing all this cos I know she\`ll read it.\
\
I\`m also in a funny mood because of my brothers birthday on Sunday. So
i\`ve been doing my yearly ritual of changing the layout and stuff of my
pitiful excuse for a website.\
\
I started messing with making a website soon after his death. Make like
a little memorial or something. It kinda helped me through it in a way.
The pictures page is only partly done. I\`m hoping to have it done
before Sunday. Dunno why. It just seems to help.\
\
Anyway, it\`s at <https://homepage.ntlworld.com/paddee/> if you feel
like looking.
