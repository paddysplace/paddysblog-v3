https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/06/faster-faster.html \-\-- Well
i\`m back, bigger, better and faster than before.\
\
Yes, I have a new PC\...woo. Zara very kindly let me spend some savings
to get some new computer parts. So now I have a lovely fast AMD 64 3000+
with 512Mb DDR400 NVidia 256Mb 6600 and a 160GB hard drive.\
\
It\`s not exactly screaming along on the bleeding edge but it\`s a hell
of a lot faster than what i\`ve been using. So i\`ve been busy trying to
get XP set up on it and get the main things installed, i.e. GAMES!!\
\
I can finally play Quake 4, and can have Half Life 2 running like it\`s
meant to.\
\
Excuse this over the top geeky moment. But. damn. It\`s good. Not bad at
Â£300 for what is basically a brand new computer.\
\
It\`ll do me for a few months anyway.\
\
Joking Zara!!\
\
We\`ve been looking after our friends guinea pig, Petal, all week. But
today was the day she went home :(\
\
So now the place seems a little bit empty. Despite having 2 cats and a
rat in permanent residence here!\
\
Well it\`s late, hot, I\`m falling asleep in the bath and my laptop
battery is nearly dead. Good a reason as any to end this post.\
\
And as a final note. Thank God that Turk twat has been booted out of Big
Brother.\
\
Ok, i\`m done now.
