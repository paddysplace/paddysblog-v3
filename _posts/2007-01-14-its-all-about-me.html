And eating copious amounts of things covered in chocolate using Zara's chocolate fountain. Pictures/videos to follow if i'm not too lazy to upload them.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">FAVORITE...</span><br />Food:   Pizza<br />Candy: Anything<br />Number: 7<br />Color: Purple<br />Animal: Dogs<br />Drink: Smirnoff Ice<br />Alcohol See above<br />Bagel: plain with jam<br />Letter: Zzzzzz<br />Body Part on Opposite sex: Oh easy....tits<br />Pepsi or Coke:           Neither really<br />McDonalds or BurgerKing:  Both as bad<br />Strawberry or Watermelon: Urgh, fruit!<br />Hot tea or Ice tea:   Neither<br />Chocolate or Vanilla   Vanilla<br />Hot Chocolate or Coffee:  Hot chocolate<br />Kiss or Hug:              Depends who it is<br />Dog or Cat:           Cat<br />Rap or Punk:           Punk<br />Summer or Winter:   Summer<br />Scary Movies or <br />Funny Movies:           Scary<br />Love or Money:           Love, with money!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR...</span><br />Bedtime:           11:00 - 12:00<br />Most Missed Memory:   My brother<br />Best phyiscal feature:   Umm<br />First Thought Waking Up:  God, not work already!<br />Goal for this year:   Make money<br />Best Friends:           Zara<br />Weakness:           Computer games<br />Fears:                   Losing loved ones<br />Longest relationship:   15 years<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">HAVE YOU...</span><br />Ever Drank:           yes<br />Ever Smoked:           yes<br />Pot:                   yes<br />Ever been Drunk:          yes<br />Ever been beaten up:      yes<br />Ever beaten someone up:   yes<br />Ever Shoplifted:   yes<br />Ever Skinny Dipped:   no<br />Ever Kissed Opposite sex: yes<br />Been Dumped Lately:       no<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">IN A GUY/GIRL</span><br />Favorite Eye Color:    blue<br />Favorite Hair Color:    blonde<br />Short or Long:            long<br />Height:                    don't mind<br />Style:                    rock chick<br />Looks or Personality:    Bit of both<br />Hot or Cute            Cute<br />Drugs and Alcohol:    Not too much of either<br />Muscular or Really Skinny: Bit of meat on her bones :)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">RANDOMS</span><br />Number of Regrets in the Past:    None<br />What country do you want to Visit: USA or Italy<br />How do you want to Die:            Quickly<br />Been to the Mall Lately:    The where?<br />Do you like Thunderstorms:    Ooh, yeah<br />Get along with your Parents:    Yes<br />Health Freak:                    God no<br />Do you think your Attractive:    No<br />Believe in Yourself:            A little<br />Want to go to College:            Yeah, easy life ;)<br />Do you Smoke:                    No<br />Do you Drink:                    Yes<br />Shower Daily:                    No...have a bath<br />Been in Love:                      Yes<br />Do you Sing:                    Badly<br />Want to get Married:            Again!<br />Do you want Children:            Nooooo<br />Hate anyone:                    Yes
