the official [Slap Your Irritating Co-workers Holiday\
]{style="font-weight:bold;"}\
Do you have a co-worker who talks nonstop about nothing, working your
last nerve with tedious and boring details that you don\'t give a damn
about?\
\
Do you have a co-worker who ALWAYS screws up stuff creating MORE work
for you?\
\
Do you have a co-worker who kisses so much booty, you can look in their
mouth and see what your boss had for lunch? Do you have a co-worker who
is SOOO obnoxious,when he/she enters a room, everyone else clears it?\
\
Well, on behalf of IkeTurner, I am so very very glad to officially
announce today as SLAP YOUR IRRITATING CO-WORKER DAY! There are the
rules you must follow:\
\
\* You can only slap one person per hour - no more.\
\* You can slap the same person again if they irritate you again in the
same day.\
\* You are allowed to hold someone down as other co-workers take their
turns slapping the irritant.\
\* No weapons are allowed\...other than going upside somebody\'s head
with a stapler or a hole-puncher.\
\* CURSING IS MANDATORY! After you have slapped the recipient,
your\"assault\" must be followed with something like \"cause I\'m sick
of your stupid-a\$\$ always messing up stuff!\"\
\
\* If questioned by a supervisor or police, (if the supervisor is the
irritant), you are allowed to LIE, LIE, LIE! Now, study the rules, break
out your list of folks that you want to slap the living day lights out
of and get to slapping\.....\
\
\...and believe me. I was so tempted!
