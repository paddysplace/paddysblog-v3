\-\-- I\`m ashamed to say i\`ve been enjoying myself far too much and
really couldn\`t be bothered to blog anything the past few days.\
\
Also getting Dawn of War: Winter Assault didn\`t help. Although not
getting to play that nearly as much as I want.\
\
Damn food n drink getting in the way.\
\
Anyway, major snowy weather today. Garfield wasted no time going outside
to test out his snow paws.\
