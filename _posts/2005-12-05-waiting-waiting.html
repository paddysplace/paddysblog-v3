Ok, so how long do you think you should wait for an item you won on ebay to be posted to you? (after paying of course!) 3 days? 5 days? 7 days? 10 days? how about 15 frickin days! and still no sign. <br /><br />I`m being patient, well up until now anyway. Sent a 2nd email off to ask the whereabouts of my item today and still waiting for a reply. I also don`t want negative feedback left if I get stroppy as this seller is likely to do.<br /><br />I`m tempted to put her email address in this post and get people to pester her about it....but I won`t...not yet anyway...grrr.
