\-\-- This week is going way too quick. Maybe it\`s because i\`m
sleeping the morning away!\
I\`ve never slept so much in my life. I really am going to have to get
to bed earlier and try and wake up a bit earlier each day in preparation
for next week!\
\
Was round at my parents until 11:30 last night watching the video I took
of my gf\`s sisters kittens.\
\
I really should add a few more videos to our \'[Our
Cats](https://uk.geocities.com/paddee28/)\' page on geocities.\
Haven\`t added anything to that in sooo long. I\`m terrible, I start
these little projects then get sidetracked and start something else!\
\
I blame the cats personaly\...mainly because all these projects usually
involve them!
