I fucking hate this time of year<br />All the little retards are wetting themselves over the fact they can let off fireworks whenever and wherever they want.<br />Even in the middle of the day.<br />Which I guess goes some way to show their mental ability.<br />I blogged about this last year. And I guess it's something that will piss me off every year, so here it is again<br /><br />Why the hell shops are allowed to sell fireworks to anybody other than organizations is beyond me.<br />Other than the fact the government would miss out on the extra revenue I guess.<br /><br />Our cat freaks out everytime one goes off. <br />Fireworks, bonfires. I could really live without this 'tradition' which has very little meaning left behind why we celebrate the 5th November.<br /><br />It happened over 400 years ago people. Time to move on.<br /><br />Guy Fawkes must be turning in his grave!
