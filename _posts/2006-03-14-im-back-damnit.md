https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/03/im-back-damnit.html \-\-- Ok,
third attempt at writing this\...must save to draft more often.\
\
Not that it\`ll be full of whitty remarks. Deep insightful comments or
tales of woe straight from the heart.\
\
Mainly cos it\`s so late and my brain isn\`t running at full capacity.\
\
Not that it ever really is.\
\
Anyway..back to the point. If there ever was one.\
\
I\`m back? Miss me? Did you even notice?\
\
Humph.\
\
Well we went down to Oxford for the weekend. Zara\`s sis\`s birthday,
former workplace re-opening, meeting of family n friends all rolled into
one 2 day frenzy.\
\
Family was met, cats were played with, pizza was eaten, mayor\`s hand
was shaken and friends were..er..hugged.\
\
So now here I lay. In a hot bubbly bath. Hey, i\`m in touch with my
feminine side. Nothing wrong with bubbles.\
\
As I was saying, here I lay pretty much knackered. Not from the hectic
weekend. Or the 180 mile journey home. So what wore me out?\
\
IKEA.\
\
IKEA. Great for browsing. A nightmare if you want to actually buy
anything.\
\
I wasn\`t in the best of moods to be traipsing round the place. Not that
I don\`t like it but I really wanted to get home.\
\
Well bathroom cabinets were eventually found. With hinges to fit, and
the doors we liked. So we left the place a couple of happy bunnies and
several pounds (the monetary kind) lighter.\
\
And now to bed.\
\
My brain is nearly at a standstill and the chance of any more coherent
sentences are rapidly diminishing.\
\
So I shall wish you all a goodnight.\
\
Goodnight.
