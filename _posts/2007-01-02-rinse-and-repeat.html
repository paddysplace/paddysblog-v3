And another crappy New Year begins.<br /><br />I'm full of cold. As soon as my holidays started I could feel it taking over my system. And now it's set up home in my head and keeps making banging noises and has installed cladding in the walls.<br /><br />Urgh.<br /><br />Anyway. Christmas was great despite all this. Oh, and Zara's wisdom tooth made a bid for freedom and has been trying to push it's way up. So she's not a happy bunny.<br /><br />Anyway, yeah. Christmas. Copious amounts of alcohol were drunk. EU food size mountains were eaten. And cool presents exchanged. And we've still got a ton of food to get through. I think we went a little mad on the shopping.<br /><br />So now I have books to read. DVD's to watch and Nintendo DS/PC games to play. <br /><br />The Wii is way more fun than I imagined (Sorry to rub it in Carto). My parents came round Boxing Day and we played Wii Sports until we couldn't move. My mum was frighteningly good at it!<br /><br />Then it was down to Oxford to stay at Zara's Dad's.... <br /><br />...ok, I'll stop typing for now. <br /><br />Don't want to make this into a novel sized post.
