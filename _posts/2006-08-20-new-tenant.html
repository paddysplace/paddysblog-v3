Look right. See. New tenant. Now go visit as she's only here for the week.<br /><br />Despite the worrying blog name. I'm sure no kittys actually get stir fried. And the fact she has more blogs on the go than can possibly be healthy for you; she seems to be quite a nice tenant.<br /><br />I'm usually quite hopeless at giving a shoutout to my tenants so hopefully you'll put some traffic her way.<br /><br />Now i've got my chores out the way I can relax after a hard day (2 hours) stressful DIY. Pictures to follow!
