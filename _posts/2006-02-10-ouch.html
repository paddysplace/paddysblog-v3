Well as Zara said I should blog this picture for posterity. And as she probably thought I wouldn`t then here it is. I apologise for those with a weak constitution for the graphic nature of this image.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/ouch.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/ouch.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Maybe I have a habit of having a tad too much hot water in my baths. I was washing my hair when Zara took the picture if anybody is wondering why my arse is in the air. If you are looking at the picture and wondering such things then I suggest you go get some sort of counselling!!
