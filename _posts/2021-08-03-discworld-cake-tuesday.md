Since the age of 16 when a college friend thrust a well read book into my hand and told me to read it saying

"You've got to read this. Death is in it, and he friends up with cocktail sticks"

I've been hooked on the late great [Terry Pratchett](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/ "Terry Pratchett")'s Discworld. The obsession has wained slightly over the years. I've read the books, listened to the audiobooks, and watched the TV adaptations \[^1\] that it's just a part of my DNA. I don't feel the need to consume the media as obsessively as I did. But every time I think about the Discworld it makes me smile with wonderful memories.

Like this one! What a fantastic segway into this cake Tuesday offering.

My mother who is equally as enthralled in the Discworld received this lovely creation for her birthday many years ago. I still think it's her favourite.

The picture quality may not be the best. I might try and dig out some better photos if they exist.

There are other Discworld cakes that will appear along the way.
