decide weather to be shocked, disgusted or amazed at what breeders are
doing.\

The Toyger is a designer cat. It is designed and bred with the demands
of modern apartment life as a human companion foremost in mind.
Glittered, pelted, dramatic pattern appeals to both the high-tech
glamour and nature-loving, wild dreams of city-caught people while the
laid back, easily trained character of these cats make them a joy to
live with.\

The Toyger is a breed in development. Recognized by TICA for
Registration early in the 1990\'s and lovely even now, the goals for the
breed are long term and the prospect even more exciting! Several of the
features proposed have never before been recognized as possible in a
domestic cat. Progress is slow but steady in all areas from
companionability to appearance
