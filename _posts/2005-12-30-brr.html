Well, another day and hopefully a better mood.<br /><br />We`re meant to be travelling down to Oxford to stay with my girlfriend`s family. Although looking at the weather I don`t know how likely that is.<br /><br />But if we go then I won`t be able to wish everyone a Happy New Year so i`ll do it now.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">HAPPY NEW YEAR</span>
