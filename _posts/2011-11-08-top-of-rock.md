Just a quick post as we're getting ready to go see a Broadway show. Oh
yes dahlings! Another busy day walking round Central Park. We saw some
TV show being filmed. Nobody seemed to know which one tho! And then
spent several hours! at the top of the Rockefeller Centre. A slightly
hazy view but another cloudless, sunny warm day in New York.
