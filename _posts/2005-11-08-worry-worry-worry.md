Checked my gas and electric account this morning after I submitted new
meter readings. Got a bit of a shock, excuse the pun. It\`s difficult to
tell how it\`ll pan out until the end of the year. But it looks like
we\`re using more than we\`re paying for.\
\
I\`m sure there\`s ways to cut down. We have a lot of computer stuff
running, some of it 24/7. Gonna find a way to cut back on the things
that don\`t need to be left on permanently and see if it makes a
difference.\
\
I\`m just a worryhead really. I guess it\`s better than not caring and
letting everything just muddle along. My girlfriend only works one day a
week so I panic sometimes that not enough money is coming into the house
no matter how many times I stare at my financies in excel.\
\
I worry about my job. A lot of similar companies are putting their
workers on shortime. Something we\`ve never had to, but I just worry cos
I know we\`ll be screwed if it came to that.\
\
I worry about our new car. Even tho if we\`d stayed as we were with
seperate cars we\`d be paying out a lot more than we are doing now.\
\
I worry about our house, cos i\`m not diy minded in the slightest! And
i\`m such a lazy sod and would prefer to just sit at my computer and
take a break from the real world.\
\
I worry about my girlfriend. She has had to make so many changes in her
life to be with me.\
\
Anyway, i\`m going to relax in the bath and read my pc format and look
at all the things i\`d love to have but can\`t afford.
