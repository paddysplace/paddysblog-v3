Ok, just had to make a quick mention on this story I read on The Superficial:<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Madonna has gotten a pair of fake eyelashes made from mink and studded with diamonds from Japanese makeup artist Shu Uemura. The Scoop alleges that the mink is real but they're not sure about the diamonds. I'll just go ahead and assume the diamonds are real as well</span>...<a href="http://www.thesuperficial.com/archives/2006/02/27/madonna_has_fake_eyelashes_1.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">more</span></a><br /><br />The original story is from a snippet on MSNBC.<br /><br />Mink eyelashes...eyelashes made from real mink?...all I can say is WHAT THE FUCK...
