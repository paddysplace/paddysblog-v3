https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/01/i-did-it.html \-\-- I\`ve been
awake 45 minutes now!\
\
Of course my workmates hammering at the door wanting my van keys kinda
helped!\
And the cat jumping off the bed growling.\
And my girlfriend making me get out of bed and answer the door..\
..unfortunately I picked up her bright green dressing gown to go answer
the door in.\
\
Not looking forward to work on Monday now!!\
\
So now here I sit. Wide awake.
