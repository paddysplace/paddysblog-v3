lack of posts the last couple of days can be put down to one thing.\
\
Nintendo DS.\
\
In a fit of spending fury I threw caution to the wind and credit card to
amazon.co.uk and ordered a lovely white Nintendo DS Lite\....in white.\
\
For a bargain price of Â£109 with a copy of Dr thingumyjig\'s Brain
Training I couldn\'t put if off any longer. And after 2 days brain
training i\`ve gone from having the brain of a 72 year old to that of a
33 year old. I\'ll let Zara comment on her progress\...hehe.\
\
So is it any good? Well after about an hour showing it off to my parents
they were straight onto amazon to order one for themselves. Family get
togethers are going to get a lot more interesting.\
\
But now I have a headache. I think i\'ve stretched my mental capacity
too far. Which doesn\'t take too long. By the end of the week my brain
should be that of a new born baby. So i\'ll be dribbling and cooing by
the weekend.\
\
Which is pretty much how I end up after a few too many.
