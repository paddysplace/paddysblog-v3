More blog surfing. Damn I wish I could take and manipulate pictures like
[this guy](https://www.parconline.blogspot.com/). My girlfriend is the
whizz with the digital camera, mainly cos it\`s never out of her hand.\
\
I just aim it at what I want to take a picture of and hope for the best.
Which is a shame as I love mucking about with pictures in Photoshop. I
just don\`t have the patience, or talent. Although my girlfriends Mum
and her new husband\`s wedding video came a step closer to completion.
So I guess i\`m good at some things.
