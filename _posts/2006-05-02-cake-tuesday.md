https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/05/cake-tuesday.html \-\-- Well
some more of our Bradgate Park visit pics are up on Flickr. Although
I\`m sure Zara will point out that i\`ve missed off some of the better
ones.\
I\`m so lazy at picking pictures.\
\
Speaking of pictures. Zara has a nice shiny folder on her hard drive
with nice shiny pictures of some of the cakes she\`s done. She did want
me to post a cake of the day, but I thought i\`d be able to stretch it
out to doing one a week,.\
And as I didn\`t think anyone would be interested in me doing a bralesss
tuesday a\`la [Bored
Housewife](https://boredhousewife.blogspot.com/2006/05/tuesday-is-it.html).
Then I thought Cake Tuesday would be a much better idea.\
\
So here it is.\

The first cake posting. It\`s a birthday cake Zara did for me. And as
you all know I like to post in the bath. And previously I used to like
to read in the bath. So Zara captured me in a perfect pose\....although
I wondered why she was taking all these photos of me laid in the bath!\
\
She even managed to get all my piercings in there as well, reading PC
Format and with Miaow asleep by my side. Note the strategically placed
bubbles.
