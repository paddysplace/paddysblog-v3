Feel as low as I did yesterday. So taken the day off work. Got my mum round helping my girlfriend play with her new mixer so i`m staying out the kitchen! <br /><br />Gonna be a bit hectic in there whilst she makes my grandad`s cake. Been messing with flickr and made another magazine cover!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/87379413@N00/52356295/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/30/52356295_b4bfb9f5bd.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="My creation" /></a>
