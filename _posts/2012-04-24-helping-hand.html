Ok. I said this blog is dead. And so it it. Well, maybe just resting.<br /><br />Helping my dads local flying club get its new domain off the ground (ahaha) so thought I would try adding a backlink here. So here it is <a href="http://www.flyatfranks.org/">http://www.flyatfranks.org/</a><br /><br />If you're in the lincolnshire area and feel like taking a trial flight to see what your house looks like from the air then check them out. Details of trial flights can be found here<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flyatfranks.org/trial-flight/">http://www.flyatfranks.org/trial-flight/</a><br /><br />There. I`ve done my bit. This totally reads like a spam advert but it's not :)
