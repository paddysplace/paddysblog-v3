as I lay here in the bath\...hmm, maybe I should do a sunday bath post.
Anyway, as I lay here Garfield is destroying the upstairs hallway. My
girlfriend is clearing out the spare room so there are bags n boxes
everywhere which are obviously hiding god knows what according to
Garfields imagination.\
\
And what is it with cats and closed doors\...they\`re just meant to be
open I guess! I had the bathroom door closed earlier, which is a big no
no according to Miaow. And she is quiet persistant about this. The door
wasn\`t closed fully so it was on the latch, but enough so it was wedged
in the door frame. I\`m sure she was taking run ups and basically just
headbutting it until it opened!\
\
Anyway, pleased with her moments work of opening another door she looked
at me, smiled\...I swear she smiled! miaowed at me and walked off.\
\
In search of other doors no doubt.
