still here. In case any of you were wondering if I survived my
birthday.\
You know who you are ;)\
I had a fantastic birthday.\
\
Got lots of great presents. Books, vouchers, alchohol, clothes,
alchohol.\
Me and Zara went to watch Silent Hill at the cinema. Yes, a nice
romantic evening out.\
\
Then back to reality on Saturday as we attempted to not get stressed
with each other as we laid the bathroom floor tiles. Which went pretty
well. Only a few minor boo boos. Mainly to do with my cutting skills and
tape measuring abilities.\
\
And yesterday we went to over to Leicester to meet Zara\`s dad and his
partner at [Bradgate
Park](https://www.leicestershire.ndirect.co.uk/FFBradgate.htm)\

Which meant for a lot of walking. A lot. So today i\`m doing as little
as possible. Nothin. Nadda. No bathroom. Very little walking. A relaxing
day.\
\
Hopefully.\

The rest of the pics will be up on Flickr soon.
