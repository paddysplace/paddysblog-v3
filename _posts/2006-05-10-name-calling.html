I`m a piscetarian!<br />And I had no idea.<br /><br />I`m vegtarian. Well, half vegetarian as I still eat fish.<br />Long story. So won`t go into it now.<br />But i`ve never really been comfortable with saying i`m vegetarian. And then trying to explain why I still eat fish.<br /><br />Well according to various sources. I`m a piscetarian. Or to get all official like<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">pescetarian</span> (PES.kuh.tayr.ee.un; PESH.uh-) <span style="font-style:italic;">n</span>. A person who supplements a vegetarian diet with fish. â€”<span style="font-style:italic;">adj</span>. Also: pescevegetarian, piscetarian.<br /><br />So now I can confuse people by telling them that instead now. As long as I can remember the damn word.<br />When it comes to remembering names i`m as hopeless as someone who`s not very good at remembering names. Which is kind of ironic I guess as isn`t a lot of fish good for the brain?
