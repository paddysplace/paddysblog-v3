I think i`ve recovered from the weekend. Had a nice long lay in this morning and intend to do as little as possible. In fact I`m going to try and do as little as poss all week as I don`t start back to work until next Monday...wooo!<br /><br />Got to meet my girlfriend`s sisters new kittens, which was great fun.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0102Image0030.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0102Image0030.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
