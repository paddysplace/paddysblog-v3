Time.\
Can\'t believe the last time I posted was Sunday. And by the lack of
comments and emails I\'ve had I guess nobody gives a toss.\
\
Well, humph to to you all. I don\'t care cos i\'ve got my ds lite. I
currently have a brain age of 36. Although maybe that should be 6 as
i\'m having great fun playing Lego Star Wars.\
\
And\...that\'s about it. I could rant about work I guess. Although i\'ve
just done that to Zara so it\'s all out my system now.\
\
If I think of something to complain about i\'ll be back!\
\
High: Seeing how much money we have in the bank!, yay to having 2 jobs
on the go!\
Low: The people I have to suffer at work.
