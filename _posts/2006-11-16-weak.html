I'm ok now. I always feel ok with the world when i'm safe in my own home. With the curtains closed and the doors locked on these cold nights.<br /><br />But out in the real world I don't often feel in control.<br /><br />I'm weak willed<br />Weak minded.<br />Weak spirited.<br /><br />An animal has probably died because of me, and I hate myself for it.<br /><br />We have a rat at work, or rats. Or something that's chewing the cables and eating the left over food we discard.<br /><br />I suggested a humane trap.<br />I just didn't hammer the point home that this was the right thing to do.<br /><br />I was weak.<br /><br />Pest control was brought in.<br />Poison was put down.<br />Now there is no sign of the little furry critter.<br /><br />I had been putting bits of crisps down in my work room. And by morning these had been eaten.<br /><br />So now the little guy is gone. And it's all down to me.<br /><br />Our workplace had bought mousetraps. Mousetraps for fuck sake!<br />It'll maim it I said.<br />Nobody listened.<br />So I made sure I was the last to leave, and then made sure the traps didn't do any kind of damage.<br /><br />So then the poison was put down.<br />And I did nothing.<br />I felt like I could do nothing.<br />I might as well have put the poison down myself.<br /><br />I'm sorry to the little fella who had the misfortune to think our workplace was a safe refuge from the cold world.<br /><br />But I guess at least he ate well whilst he stayed in my work room.<br /><br />I'm just weak.
