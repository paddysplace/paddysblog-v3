being a surrogate parent, or a halfway house\...or whatever you want to
call us. I just couldn\`t do it.\
\
We looked after a friends new guinea pig from last Wednesday to Sunday.
It\`s was her lad\`s birthday and little piggy was the present he\`s
been wanting for a long time. So we did the decent thing and did our
best to hold lil piggy hostage, lol.\
\
Ok, not really\...but it tempting.\
\
She may not have done much. She may have only sat in her cage as quietly
as possible. But it feels a little emptier in the house now.\
\
And as can be seen

\
We need more pets\...the house is too empty with only ourselves 2 cats
and a rat.\
