\-\-- Ok, feeling mellow. Chilled out. Relaxed.\
Downright sleepy infact!\
\
So this will be more of a mumble than a coherent post (so what\`s new I
hear you cry!)\
\
I have nothing to whinge about, no rant about work. Life is peachy.\
\
Due to the fact i\`ve only just learnt that NTL have dropped the 3Gb a
month cap on upload/downloads i\`ve been adding pictures and videos like
mad.\
\
So anyone who is interested. And didn\`t get an invite email off me here
are the pages for my pics and vids.\

\
Again, all work is excellently produced by Zara and uploaded by yours
truly. I\`m a sucker for signing up on sites so if you know of anything
similar or better I can add my already overworked email address to then
let me know.\
\
Sigh, so that\`s it really. I think i\`m just too tired to post anything
interesting. Or maybe i\`ve just had a dull day.\
\
Maybe I should wait to be tagged so I can answer some indepth questions
;)
