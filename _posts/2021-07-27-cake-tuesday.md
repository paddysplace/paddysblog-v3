Many moons ago. In the dark and distant past. I had a blogger blog. An, if not successful, then maybe a slightly popular one.

And then for some reason. I got bored with it.  And left it gathering dust.

Until now.

Where for some reason blogging has sparked a small fire inside me.

My girlfriend has stopped making celebration cakes. But the photos are still with us.
