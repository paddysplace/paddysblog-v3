https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2005/11/ho-hum.html \-\-- Well the
snow didn\`t last long, soon turned into rain. And now it\`s just bloody
cold n wet n miserable. Hasn\`t been the most interesting of days
really. The boss came back to work from yet another holiday which
probably didn\`t help anybody\`s mood. He filled my workroom with his
new toy\...a karaoke machine. I put it all just outside of my room and
when I got back off delivery it was all pretty much set up. 2 bloody
great speakers set up! We\`re such a professional company.\

Trying to find a use for an old 200Mhz PC, other than as a doorstop.
I\`ve been thinking of sticking Linux on it and setting it up next to
the tv just for internet access and check tv schedules. Something else
for my girlfriend to sigh, shake her head at me about and ask me
\'why?\'. Other than \'because I can\' I don\`t really have a proper
answer. Maybe i\`m as bad as my boss and his wonderful Ideas.
