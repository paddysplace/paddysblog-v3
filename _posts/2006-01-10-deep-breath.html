Ok, i`m angry, i`m arsey..i`m seriously pissed off.<br /><br />This was going to be a rant about work...but after watching celebrity big brother I really have to get this out my system. <br /><br />Pete Burns needs to get his big disfigured fucking face from up his own arse and stop spouting the fucking scouse fucking bollocks that comes out his balloon sized lips.<br /><br />He`s not the only freak in their, but the only one I want to take a crowbar to! And I don`t even want to get started on Galloway and Barrymore!<br /><br />Ok, I feel better now...i`m calm....well, about BB anyway.<br /><br />Now, work. Ah yes. The wonderful place of employment. I`ve only been back 2 days and i`m ready for another holiday. <br /><br />Got our pay yesterday and found out that we didn`t get paid for the full day the last Friday we worked. Now the past 3 years i`ve been there we finish at 12 (but pays us for a full day) on the last day and all go for a Christmas piss up.<br /><br />Not this year. Our boss (again, as last year) generously put £300 behind the bar for drinks for all of us.<br /><br />Then manages to make that £300 back by not paying us for a full day. So basically we bought our own Christmas drinks.<br /><br />Merry Fucking Christmas.<br /><br />Now, if this happened year after year I wouldn`t have a problem with it. But we knew nothing about it. Had no say in the matter and didn`t find out until yesterday.<br /><br />People are pissed off to say the least.<br /><br />So no christmas bonus, no party, vans are breaking down, no pay rise as promised last October and a million other little things that just make the day to day job just that little bit more stressful.<br /><br />Time for a job hunt this year methinks.
