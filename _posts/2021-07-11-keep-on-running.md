**Week 3 - Run 1**

<br>

<p>This is not getting any easier. I didn't think it would. I'd hoped. Trying to follow c25k is not easy when you only run once a week. Motivation is the killer. I am completely lacking in it. I _want _to do it. But this invisible forcefield keeps holding me back. </p>

<p>I know one run a week is better than none. Just. But depression can be crippling first thing in the morning. The thought of another full day of stress, cats and the inability to want to do anything is strong. </p>

<p>Weekdays I barely have the energy to get out of bed. Let alone go for a run! Weekends I just want to wallow in self pity. I'm sure the more I run the better I will feel. But getting over that first hurdle is challenging.</p> 

<p>But, I feel good today. Getting that run out of the way has left me with a sense of achievement and aching legs. The good kind of ache. The ache you get from doing something.  I'm not sure I'll ever feel the full effects of a runners hight. And I don't know if I'll ever run for a full 5k.</p>

<p>As long as I keep trying then wherever I get to I have to view it as an achievement and not a failure.</p>
