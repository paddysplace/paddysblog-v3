https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2005/12/where-am-i.html \-\-- Ah,
another typical Friday and another typical week at work over with. I\`ve
been reassured my job is safe. Although I still have my doubts. Our
manager had to tell one of the lads he\`s being laid off today which was
a bit shitty tho. But I was pleased I was gonna be ok, which kinda made
me feel a bit guilty.\
\
I don\`t know how it started but we ended up playing \'whats the capital
of\...\'. I think my grey cells are really starting to deteriorate as I
couldn\`t remember half of them!. Of course I do have the excuse that
it\`s been about 20 years since I was in a geography lesson. But without
running to the atlas try naming the capital cities of\
\
Turkey\
Switzerland\
Kenya\
Brazil\
\
off the top of your head. I did find a really good website on the works
computer and ended up running in and out the office to check the
answers\...mainly to stop the arguments before there was bloodshed!
