I'm a nobody. I guess we all are at some point in our lives. Maybe. Or maybe it's just me.

I'm on all the usual social media sites under a different username. Got a few acquaintances and people that could be called friends following me.

So why have I hit the reset button? Started from scratch. Where nobody will read this. Nobody will follow me. I'm not a social person by nature. I don't have any words of wisdom or skills to offer the world.

I'm

1. A fifty something
2. Vegan (non pushy)
3. With depression
4. Someone who likes the idea of friends. But doesn't like people.

So why the hell would I want to attract people to read my very inarticulate blog, look at my mundane pictures or talk to a depressing introvert?

I think I'm trying to find myself again. I used to have a blogger blog back in the dark ages, and a livejournal and a Tumblr. I recently migrated my old blogger posts to this blog. It was interesting going over them again. Like finding an old diary. I enjoyed being on blogger until I didn't. 

Maybe I just need this right now. A fresh start. Just a new me on the internet. Where nobody knows me. And maybe nobody will want to know me.

And I'm ok with that.
