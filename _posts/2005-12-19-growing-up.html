Well, in a break from me pouring my heart out here, which is emotionaly exhausting, and after reading gemmak`s blog about Tilly. I got to thinking how much Garfied has changed over the past year.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2004_1105Image0013.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2004_1105Image0013.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />This is from 15 November 2004. I tried to get two similar shots to show how much he`s grown. I wanted one from about this time in December 2004 but couldn`t really find similar shots.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2005_1207Image0054.0.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2005_1207Image0054.0.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />And this is how he looks now! Taken a couple of weeks ago. He can hardly fit on his pedestal! Not that stops him trying.<br /><br />Hope he stops growing soon!!
