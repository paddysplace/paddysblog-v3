I`m feeling so bleurgh at the moment.<br />No. I have no idea what that means.<br />I just know I am.<br /><br />It`s that 'can`t be bothered with anything' feeling.<br /><br />I can`t be bothered to write stuff anymore.<br />I can`t be bothered to be nice to people.<br />...or show an interest.<br />...or play pc games.<br />...or listen to podcasts.<br />...or watch tv.<br /><br />I just want to be.<br />To vegitate and move as little as possible.<br />To sit totally silent in a silent room with only my own thoughts bouncing off the inside of my head.<br /><br />It`s not often I feel like this. Maybe it`s the crappy day i`ve had with Zara. Or the fact I have to go to work tomorrow.<br /><br />Let`s just blame it on the weather. It`s usually at fault somewhere along the line.<br /><br />So i`m trying to fill my head with interesting stuff in the hope it`ll push the bleurghyness out my ears.<br /><br />I`m fascinated with Medieval English History. And am learning all sorts of things about Anglo-Saxons. Stuff which I was probably taught in primary school but didn`t listen to.<br /><br />I`ll probably bore Zara with it later and pass the bleurghyness onto her.<br /><br />Well, it`s good to share.
