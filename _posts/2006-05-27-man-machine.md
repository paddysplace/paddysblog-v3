can\`t take any credit for this post, but it cracks me up so much I had
to post a snippet. Go

[Attu question: what program are you running at the
moment?:]{style="font-style:italic;"}\
\
Last year a friend of mine upgraded from GirlFriend 6.0 to Wife 1.0 and
found that it\'s a memory hog leaving very little system resources
available for other applications. He is now noticing that Wife 1.0 is
also spawning Child Processes which are further consuming valuable
resources. No mention of this particular phenomena was included in the
product brochure or the documentation, though other users have informed
him that this is to be expected due to the nature of the application.\
\
Not only that, Wife 1.0 installs itself such that it is always launched
at system initialization, where it can monitor all other system
activity. He\'s finding that some applications such as PokerNight 10.3,
BeerBash 2.5, and PubNight 7.0 are no longer able to run in the system
at all, crashing the system when selected (even though they always
worked fine before). During installation, Wife 1.0 provides no option as
to the installation of undesired Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw 55.8 and
BrotherInLaw Beta release. Also, system performance seems to diminish
with each passing day.\
\
Some features he\'d like to see in the upcoming wife 2.0.\
\
1. a \"Don\'t remind me again\" button\
2. a Minimize button\
3. An install shield feature that allows Wife 2.0 be installed with the
option to uninstall at any time without the loss of cache and other
system resources\
4. An option to run the network driver in promiscuous mode which would
allow the system\'s hardware probe feature to be much more useful.\
\
I myself decided to avoid the headaches associated with Wife 1.0 by
sticking with Girlfriend 7.0. Even here, however, I found many problems.
Apparently you cannot install Girlfriend 7.0 on top of Girlfriend 6.0.
You must uninstall Girlfriend 6.0 first. Other users say this is a long
standing bug that I should have known about. Apparently the versions of
Girlfriend have conficts over shared use of the I/O port. You think they
would have fixed such a stupid bug by now. To make matters worse, The
uninstall program for Girlfriend 6.0 doesn\'t work very well leaving
undesirable traces of the application in the system. Another thing \--
all versions of Girlfriend continually popup little annoying messages
about the advantages of upgrading to Wife
1.0\...[more](https://www.i-am-bored.com/bored_link.cfm?link_id=17620)
