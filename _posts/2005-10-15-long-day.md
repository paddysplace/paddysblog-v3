https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2005/10/long-day.html \-\-- Been to my
grandparents today with my grandads birthday cake. Had a great time. Met
the goose and gander, and hen that he keeps in the back garden. Got some
cool pics of me being kept quiet by gander, lol.\

Went for a meal and a wander about the town, was a real nice relaxing
day. Crashed out in the bath on my laptop wondering why MY legs ache
after walking round town with an 80 year old!
