The idea being that each model takes Zara no more then 30 mins!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0703Image0034.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0703Image0034.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />How she does them in 30mins is beyond me!<br /><br />Each 'cake' is actually a dummy. Made up of a polystyrene block and covered with icing.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0703Image0032.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0703Image0032.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />She's made 12 dummy cake designs in all. Using 3 dummys, taking photos of the results. Stripping the decoration off then adding new models and words.<br /><br />As always, any questions leave em in the comments and the boss will answer.
