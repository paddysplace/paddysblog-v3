My feet hurt. My feet have gone passed the point of hurting. We've
walked round Manhattan Island today I think.

We went down to the WTC memorial which I found very hard to be near.
Felt very emotional for some reason. Walked along the edge of the river
and through wall street. Managed to avoid joining the 'occupy wall
street' protest. Stayed in Battery Park looking out over the Hudson
River towards the Statue of Liberty whilst the sun set. Another
emotional moment for both of us this time.

So a bit of retail therapy was called for, and after a bit of walking
around Times Square we found the M&M and Hershey's stores. Zara was in
chocolate heaven.
