Made my first skype to skype call earlier! ok it wasn`t to talk to a person. Got to leave a voicemail message to a podcaster. The MikeTechShow is one of the coolest podcasts around. I spend most of my days listening to podcasts instead of music on my ipod. Anyway, left a typical nerdy 'i think your show is great' type message so it wasn`t exactly a momentous occassion. Took me most of the damn afternoon getting my headphone settings right so I could hear properly. Wasn`t until I found the volume control on the headset that I realised what was going wrong!<br /><br />Anyway, skype me if you`ve got it. I`ve got voicemail so leave a message so I feel all warm n popular!
