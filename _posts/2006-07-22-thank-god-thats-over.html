The worst week is nearly over.<br />Just when I thought it was safe to breath a sigh of relief I get a phone call from my mum.<br />There other little rat died this morning.<br />Sigh.<br />So for the first time in a long time we are a rat free family.<br /><br />This situation won't last long. Zara is struggling without her little furry friends in the house.<br />The Wall where the rat house sits is devoid of life.<br />And it doesn't feel right.<br /><br />We're not replacing Sooty.<br />We haven't forgotten about him<br />Or gotten over his death.<br /><br />We're just adding to our family again.<br /><br />Thanks to all you guys for the kind words. We sometimes wonder if we're the only one that are passionate about animals. <br /><br />Personally I prefer their company to that of people most of the time. But the odd kind word from humans doesn't go amiss :)
