https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/10/fine-day.html \-\-- Today has
been good.\
Actually today has been fucking excellent.\
It all started well by me n Zara beating each other.\
Er, at Mario Kart DS and Tetris that is.\
\
If I see another cool video showing off the Wii i\'m gonna explode.
Either that or Zara will really beat me!\
\
So how was today also a good day.\
Well.\
Nicky Hayden only won the 2006 MotoGP championship. Woo\
Woo.\
And woo again.\
Also another reason for Zara to do me in as i\'ve been like a kiddy in a
candy/DS store.\
\
Best. Race. Ever. Although I didn\'t actually watch much of the race.
Instead I was glued to my laptop with the timing screen on.\
\
Ok, I imagine none of you reading this has the faintest idea what i\'m
babbling on about.\
But damnit. It\'s my blog , so I\'ll woo as much as I want.\
\
Woo.\
\
Ok, i\'m done now.\
\
Not the most exciting news to many, not the most interesting thing I\'ve
got to say about my whole weekend. But it\'ll do for now.
