Well I was gonna type a ton of stuff here. But as usual got sidetracked.<br /><br />So now I've got to get out the bath and go let the four monster rats out for a run around. Thank God  it's Bank Holiday. It takes the two of us to make sure none of them get into any mischief!<br /><br />I've finally gotten round to stretching my ear piercings...a little at a time. I'd forgotten how much it hurts.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/2320/2148/1600/stretch.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/2320/2148/320/stretch.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I'll be up to a pitiful 7mm before I know it!
