I've bottled it up long enough. Well, actually I haven't 'cos I tend to rant to Zara about him...but anyway, today was extra special.<br /><br />There's this guy.<br /><br />Wow, now that sounds gay! Ok, there's this workmate. He's only been working for us about a month. But been working in the industry about 7 years. But, well, how can I put this.<br /><br />Chocolate fireguard<br />Chocolate teapot<br />Ashtray on a motorbike<br />Fart in a paperbag<br /><br />All the above are more useful than this guy. <br /><br />I try to talk to him as little as possible. But in a place with only half a dozen people in it; that makes it kinda difficult.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Him:</span> So do you like listening to Christina Aquawhatsherface (ok, I made thayt last name up, but you know who I mean)<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Me:</span> Not really, she's damn sexy tho.<br />Him: Yeah, what about Bouncy (Beyonce, or whatever her name is)<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Me:</span> Umm, no.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Him:</span> Where's the chair? (there's a chair out in the factory for us to use, but I nicked it and put it in my work room)<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Me:</span> In my room (which you should already know as you saw me sitting on it before tea break)<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Him,</span> Oh, what's it in there for.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Me:</span> What the hell do you think it's in there for...decoration!<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Me:</span> *leaps over workbench to batter muppet senseless*<br /><br />Ok, maybe the last two bits didn't happen...but it was close.<br /><br />Now, I guess he was probably just trying to make conversation. But i'm not the chitty chatty kind of person. But he doesn't seem to take the hint.<br /><br />And...he doesn't really seem to take in my, um, natural surroundings.<br /><br />I have long hair<br />I have piercings and tattoos<br />I generally wear linkin park, Limp Bizkit t-shirts<br />I wear a Deftones hooded top<br /><br />Do I look like the kind of person to listen to Be-bloody-once. Or be interested in the fact you went to see Kylie last year.<br /><br />I must sound like a right twat talking about him like this. But if you had to work with him 8 hours a day you'd understand. I think most workplaces have at least one person they could do without.<br /><br />Maybe i've been that person!<br /><br />Meh, such is life. Ok, i'm done.
