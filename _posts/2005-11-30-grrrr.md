\-\-- Well i\`m in quite a good mood at the minute, so it feels a bit
funny that i\`m gonna have a rant. I\`ve been holding this in all day
really so I should let it out.\
\
Am I the only human being who literally \'wouldn\`t hurt a fly\'? A
workmate came in with a wasp clinging onto the back of his jacket. He\`d
been up in a warm, dark workspace so I guess the wasp had gone their to
hibernate (if they do!) or something. Anyway, I managed to remove his
passanger from him and the little thing just fell to the ground. All
groggy like. It just about manages to get the strength to start to fly
when this other guy I work with took this almighty swipe with this foot
and kicked it across the room!\
\
Now, I know it\`s \'only a wasp\' but come on! There was no need for
that. The wasp landed on a table and was clearly injured. One leg looked
all broken up and it couldn\`t seem to walk straight or anything. I
ended up having to kill it as quickly as I could.\
\
It just fucks me off when people do such pointless things. Kicking a
wasp to death or kicking a puppy to death, I personally do not
differentiate between animals. Then!..then!..the guy said \'aww, I feel
kinda sorry for it now\'. Then why the fuck do it in the first place!\
\
Maybe i\`m too soft, but I think i\`d rather be that way sometimes.
