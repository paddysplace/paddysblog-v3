Yeah, i`m bored tonight. <br /><br />I`m really sleepy actually. I`m blaming the weather as both me n Zara have had no energy the past couple of days. Just can`t seem to get motivated. And then today at work Rob said he felt the same! So it`s either that or they`re putting something in our water up here.<br /><br />I don`t think it helped that halfway through the week our boss decided to piss us off by informing us we cant` use the vans to go home in on our lunch break. Yeah, that would have been fine if he`d laid down the ground rules when we first started taking the vans home.<br /><br />I swear he just sits in his office thinking off ways to wind us up. It bloody works whatever he does. Anyway, i`m still using the van. It was the lamest of reasons he used for us not using them. And until we`re provided with a canteen then he has little choice but to let us.<br /><br />Well the bath panel arrived today. Looks great, no marks, no scratches, doesn`t fit...arrghh!. So we have to 'modify' some of Rod`s workwork. Other than that. It looks really good.<br /><br />Well, i`ll leave you with what we are often faced with when trying to get into bed. It`s not as scary as it looks. He hides under the duvet whenever he gets scared. Like when the binmen come round.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0223Image0055.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0223Image0055.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
