Wow weekly posts now!<br />There isn't enough me to go round. Which sounds kinda big headed. I mean there isn't enough time to fit all of me in. I never seem to get the things I want done. Or have the time to get them done in.<br /><br />Upload pictures, upload video. Set the spare pc up as a file server....again.  Play Zelda on the Wii. Talk to friends online who never seem to be online anymore goddamit where are you people. Blog more! Oh, and other stuff I can't really think of right now damn my brain.<br /><br />The only time I seem to get to myself is the hour (or two) I have in the bath. And then i'm too relaxed to blog or anything. I need another me...or a Mii, heh. One to do all the stuff that needs to be done and on to go off quietly and do the stuff I'd really like to get done.<br /><br />Well at least i've got a blog post in.
