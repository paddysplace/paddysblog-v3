\-\-- Going to attempt to get through this post rant free.
[Gemmak](https://www.jmw500.blogspot.com/)got more of a response from my
post that I did! Fortunately it was from like minded people.\
\
I was kind of sad noticing how many visitors I had since posting the
article and how little response I got, both on here and on newsvine.
Looks like apathy is alive and well on the blogosphere. Urgh, I do hate
that word. But thank you to
[Gemmak](https://www.jmw500.blogspot.com/)for voting for me.\
\
Well someone else seeded the article from a different site and it looks
like it\`s heading towards the frontpage. And is getting a lot of
feedback.\
\
So onto other things.\
\
Well, i\`m tired. Not as tired as last night. But that\`s mainly because
I haven\`t had to drive to Mansfield and back to pick up a damn window
frame. Yeah, we\`re so organised I could just cry\...phhft!\
\
Still the boss and his royal wife are on the first of there 4 holidays
they\`ll take this year next week so at least the place will run a bit
smoother.\
\
Anyway, enough grumbling. See that thing just below my banner? thats my
cloud! my tagcloud\...well, zoomcloud.\
\
No, I don\`t know if I like it there either but it was something new I
could sign up for and clog my blog up with. Just click on a word that
sounds interesting and it\`ll show you all the posts where I used that
word! Clever stuff.\
\
Although I must apologise to
[Celena](https://celenaszoo.blogspot.com/)whose name is unfortunately
next to the word bitch!\...the 2 words are totally\
unconnected ;)\
\
And finally\...stay away from Galaxy Promises. Eating a full bar of the
stuff makes your tum a bit queezy.\
\
Believe me\
\
I know
