\-\-- Well I wasn\`t even awake properly and I managed to upset my
girlfriend.\
\
By some bizarre twist of fate my girlfriend was wide awake first thing
this morning and I was soooo sleepy.\
\
So she did her best to wake me up, which pissed me off. Cos when I\`m
awake I just get up and play on the pc.\
\
So I stuck my ipod on and started drifting off again.\
\
So now she\`s grumpy with me. And I haven\`t even got out of bed yet!\
\
Sigh, so now i\`m laid here all alone as even the cats have abandoned
me.\
\
Ok, my attempt at sympathy is over.
