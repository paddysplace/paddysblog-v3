https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/05/burn-her.html \-\-- Anybody
who has been reading my ramblings for a while may remember a particular
nasty post about a Chinese bitch who took part in a cat crush video.
Well she\`s been found.\
\
This is part of the story from
<https://www.danwei.org/archives/002459.html>. No nastiness in it so
it\`s safe to read:\
\
[Yesterday, someone posted a letter online accepting partial
responsibility for the cat mutilation photos that have gotten people
riled up. And the rest of the details of the case have now come to
light.\
\
The Beijing News reports that the man in question, Li Yuejun, received
1000 yuan for recruiting the performer in the video. The woman in the
video, a Ms. Wang, worked in hospital in Luobei County in Heilongjiang.
The county government said that she was divorced, and a little not right
in the head.\
\
Li did not shoot the video, however. Two employees of a Hangzhou
Internet company were the producers of the film, and sent one to
Heilongjiang to shoot it.]{style="font-style:italic;"}\
\
And what\`s to be done with her?\
Nothing.\
No surprise really from a country that doesn\`t even recognise basic
human rights. I\`m sure someone will hopefully \'inflict\' some justice
on her.\
And she\`s a nurse for fuck sake!\
\
Anyway here is the story of how she was tracked down. Again it\`s safe
to read, but a little long:\
\
[HONK KONG]{style="font-weight:bold;"}: The photographic images, grabbed
from a video clip that was on sale until recently on some websites, show
a Chinese-looking woman in a slinky dress standing alongside a river and
talking endearingly to a kitten that she holds in her gloved hands.\
\
But soon that ice-candy image gives way to a macabre scene as she places
the kitten [\*snipped nasty description\*]{style="font-style:italic;"}\
\
There is, of course, no accounting for human perversions. Even so, the
gruesome images from a 'crush video' that celebrates cruelty to animal
as a sadomasochistic sexual stimulant set off a wave of revulsion among
Chinese netizens and animal lovers.\
\
It also triggered one of the most enterprising online investigations
driven solely by citizens (but which would do Scotland Yard proud),
which culminated in the public shaming of the high-heeled cat-killer.
Here's a blow-by-blow account of how the civilian cyber-sleuths tracked
down the culprit.\
\
Within days of the videos and photographic images being posted on the
web, a Chinese netizen put out a 'Wanted' poster with the photograph of
the woman and sought out Web-users' help in identifying her and the
location of the killing.\
\
The background images of a tower provided some clues. Professional
tourist guides, who were shown the photographs, identified it as a
landmark in a park in north-eastern Heilongjiang province.\
\
Further Web-trawling revealed that these images were part of a larger
collection that was for sale on www.\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.\*\*\*. The website
was soon closed down, but from the domain registration information, the
sleuths gathered that the images had been uploaded in Hangzhou by a
person bearing the handle of 'gainmas', with the mail ID
info\@winfox.com.\
\
A search on Google.cn --- that accursed search engine that has been
pilloried for doing business in China --- for the telephone number
listed on the site led the cyber-sleuths to a company with the name of
Silver Fox Technology that was also listed at the same Hangzhou
address.\
\
More personal details about gainmas came tumbling out rapidly: gainmas
was shown to have a silver-grey Mazda with a Zhejiang registration, and
a search on the auction site ebay.com.cn revealed that gainmas had
purchased a pair of 12-cm-heeled shoes in January 2005.\
\
Meanwhile, another line of investigations was undertaken to track down
the woman in the images. One red-herring was thrown at these sleuths,
when one web-post claimed that the woman in the pictures was, in fact,
Japanese, and that this was an advertisement for a well-known brand of
Japanese shoes.\
\
Localising the search to Helongjiang province, the cyber-sleuths finally
identified her Wang Jeu, a 37-year-old nurse at the Luobei People's
Hospital in Luobei county. Having been publicly identified and shamed,
Wang earlier this week offered a public apology to animal lovers for her
senseless, sadistic act.\
\
She claimed that she had been persuaded into performing for the camera
at a time when she was in emotional turmoil following a divorce.\
\
The episode is striking for two aspects: it shows up the amazing
possibilities of the Web, even in a society where information flow is
restricted.\
\
But equally important, it shows what heightened civic consciousness and
public outrage can do. The netizens who tracked down the high-heeled
cat-killer of Luobei county are worthy of a place in the Cybersleuths
Hall of Fame.
