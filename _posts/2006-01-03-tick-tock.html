So it`s nearly 2am and i`m in bed on my own.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Cos my girlfriend is perfecting the calendar she`s making for my parents.<br />She`s like that. She has so much patience for these things it`s unbelievable.<br />She also gets incredibly stressed doing these things. Is that possible? to be so stressed yet have the patience to sit their and not move until it`s 100% to her standards.<br /><br />Well, i`m not on my own anymore, Miaow has joined me.<br /><br />2am...I didn`t wake up until 10:30 this morning. I`m usually awake at about 8am. It`s going to be sooo hard getting up for work next monday.<br /><br />I really am going to have to stop dwelling on that until at least Sunday night.
