Another problem solved. Just waiting for my personal tester <a href="http://www.jmw500.blogspot.com/">gemmak</a> to give me the all clear. Damn tag-board. Served me right I guess for not reading the site properly about popups in the free version. <br /><br />As I use firefox all the time I never saw them. Anyway, all is fixed and using <a href="http://www.myshoutbox.com/start/?LANG=US">shoutbox</a> now. Seems a lot better.<br /><br />Well i`ve got <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">bloglines</a>, <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com/">blogrolling</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://www.frappr.com/">frappr</a> and <a href="http://www.43things.com/">43 things</a> running on my blog, is there anything i`ve missed I should be adding? :).<br /><br />I think i`m addicted to adding these things.
