https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/03/calm\_14.html \-\-- I\`m
feeling so bleurgh at the moment.\
No. I have no idea what that means.\
I just know I am.\
\
It\`s that \'can\`t be bothered with anything\' feeling.\
\
I can\`t be bothered to write stuff anymore.\
I can\`t be bothered to be nice to people.\
\...or show an interest.\
\...or play pc games.\
\...or listen to podcasts.\
\...or watch tv.\
\
I just want to be.\
To vegitate and move as little as possible.\
To sit totally silent in a silent room with only my own thoughts
bouncing off the inside of my head.\
\
It\`s not often I feel like this. Maybe it\`s the crappy day i\`ve had
with Zara. Or the fact I have to go to work tomorrow.\
\
Let\`s just blame it on the weather. It\`s usually at fault somewhere
along the line.\
\
So i\`m trying to fill my head with interesting stuff in the hope it\`ll
push the bleurghyness out my ears.\
\
I\`m fascinated with Medieval English History. And am learning all sorts
of things about Anglo-Saxons. Stuff which I was probably taught in
primary school but didn\`t listen to.\
\
I\`ll probably bore Zara with it later and pass the bleurghyness onto
her.\
\
Well, it\`s good to share.
