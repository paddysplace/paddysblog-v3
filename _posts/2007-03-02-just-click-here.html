Well we're surviving without Sky One so far. Zara was very brave and deleted the channels from her <a href="https://www.digiguide.com/">Digiguide </a>so we don't get any reminders when I the shows we can no longer watch are about to start.<br /><br />We're now getting into watching Heroes on SciFi channel instead.<br /><br />So now it's the weekend. Zara is at work, i`m waiting for my bath to run. So what do I do?<br /><br />Sign up to a new web services! Woo hoo!<br /><br />It's a disease, I swear it is.<br /><br />So my latest foray into the digital world is to have a <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">tumblr </a>account.<br /><br />So what's tumblr. Other than a new Web 2.0 service that likes to leave out the odd vowel. According to the blurb:<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Tumblelogs  are like blogs with less fuss. Tumblr is your friendly and free tool for creating tumblelogs.</span> <br /><br />So there you go. Add this <a href="https://paddysplace.tumblr.com/">link</a> to go have a look. Add the rss feed and then wait weeks for me to post anything new.<br /><br />Well I have a reputation to keep you know!
