Thats how I feel right now. I can`t explain why really. It`s just something in me feels that whatever I do isn`t good enough. Or the right thing to do.<br /><br />It`s probably best I just stay out of everybody`s way. I hate times like this. I don`t feel like i`m in control of anything. <br /><br />I`m just tired I guess. Low. <br /><br />I should be used to criticism or the comments. Maybe I just let the words hurt me too much.
