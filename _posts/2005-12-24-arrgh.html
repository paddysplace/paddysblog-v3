Bloody typical. First day of my hols and i`m wide awake! Been wide awake since 6am!<br /><br />Still feeling seriously festive though. Even though technically it`s the weekend, so wouldn`t be going to work anyway. Ah well.<br /><br />So I was laying in bed thinking I should do my own little review of the year. Couldn`t really think of anything much so, as I won`t see any of them until next year thought I would rant about the people I work with!<br /><br />Ok, then I thought, hmm what if any of the read this. So decided, what if I could condence it down to one word to say how I feel about them. So here goes.<br /><br />This will probably be the most boring blog entry i`ve made this year. But it`s early, i`m awake, so you can suffer too :)<br /><br />CW: Supercilious<br />SW: Immature<br />LT: Bossy<br />LB: Nice<br />RJ: Cool<br />PW: Arrogant<br />SC: Sarcastic<br />AT: Apathetic<br />AA: Assuming<br /><br />That`s about it really. The rest I don`t really care about one way or the other. <br /><br />Well that killed off a few minutes. Time to take to Neverwinter Nights.<br /><br />Lets go kill some orc!
