Ok, couldn`t think of a suitable title so thought i`d comment on how long it`s taking to copy 100Mb over from my main pc to my laptop via wireless. Only 3 minutes to go now...sigh.<br /><br />So how was Paddy`s day going I hear you ask. Or maybe you don`t ask but I`m gonna tell you anyway.<br /><br />It started well. It started very well. Although I shan`t go into that as Zara will get embarrassed, and then violent! <br /><br />Ooh, 25 secs to go until I can watch MacBreak.<br /><br />Anyway. We had snow last night. A lot of snow. Most of which melted today. But just left enough for Garfield to go mental in and try and eat.<br /><br />Shopping was done. Parent visiting was done.<br /><br />Then we watched Crash. Wow. What a film. I felt so drained after watching it. I actually didn`t want it to end, I could have watched another hour or so of it. I feel I should wax deep n meaningful over it but i`m tired. And slightly grumpy as I managed to put myself in the doghouse with Zara over where I hung some towels.<br /><br />One day i`ll manage to go 24 hours without managing to piss her off or upset her in some way. But maybe due to the fact i`m male that that`s an impossibility.<br /><br />So i`m laid here...yes it`s a bath moment again. First since Thursday night due to much tiling drama on Friday night. I`ve got my videocasts on my laptop and a nice hot bath and a glass of Glenfiddich so I`m a happy bunny.<br /><br />Until tomorrow that is. And thats when the plasterboarding begins.
