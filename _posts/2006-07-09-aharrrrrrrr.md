there mateys.\

Ok, thats enough. Can\'t be arsed to think of any more pirate styley
sayings. Went to watch Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\'s Chest at
the cinema today. And just to get us in the mood, and to remind us what
Capt Jack Sparrow was all about we watched the first one in bed this
morning.\
\
Well, we started watching it in bed last night. But I have this amazing
knack of being able to fall sound asleep after five minutes of watching
any film in bed.\
\
Anyway, back to the film. Was it good? Bloody right it was. Just as good
as the first one. If you didn\'t like that one then what the hell\'s
wrong with you. It\'s got frikkin pirates in it damnit. Oh, and Keira
Knightley\...mmmm\...\
\
..ahem.\
\
Naturally I had to take my mum with me as well as Zara. Life would\'t be
worth living if my mum found out i\'d seen a film with Orlando Bloom in
it and not taken her!\
\
So ignore what the critics say about the film. I swear they\'re paid NOT
to like films sometimes. And go watch.\
Go.\
Now!
