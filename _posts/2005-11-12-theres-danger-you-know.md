There\'s a danger you know.\
You can\'t own just one, for the craving will grow.\
There\'s no doubt they\'re addictive, wherein lies the danger\
While living with lots, you\'ll grow poorer and stranger.\
\
One cat is not trouble, and two are so funny,\
The third one is easy, the fourth one\'s a honey\
The fifth is delightful, the sixth ones a breeze.\
You find you can live with a house full, with ease.\
\
So how \'bout another? Would you really dare?\
They\'re really quite easy, but Oh Lord, the hair!\
With cats on the sofa and cats on the bed,\
And crates in the kitchen, its no bother, you said.\
\
They\'re really no trouble, their manners are great.\
What\'s just one more cat and one more little crate?\
The sofa is hairy, the windows are crusty.\
The floor is all footprints, the furniture\'s dusty.\
\
The housekeeping suffers, but what do you care?\
Who minds a few nose prints and a little more hair?\
So let\'s keep a kitten, you can always find room.\
And a little more time for the dust cloth and broom.\
\
There\'s hardly a limit to the cats you can add\
the thought of a cutback, sure makes you feel sad.\
Each one is special, so useful, so funny,\
The food bill grows larger, you owe the vet money.\
\
Your folks never visit, few friends come to stay,\
Except other cat folks, who live the same way.\
Your lawn has now died and your shrubs are dead, too.\
Your weekends are busy, you\'re off with your crew.\
\
There\'s cat food and vitamins, grooming and shots\
And entries and travel and motels, which cost lots.\
Is it worth it you wonder? Are you caught in a trap?\
Then that favorite comes up and climbs in your lap.\
\
His look says you\'re special and you know that you will\
Keep all of the kittens in spite of the bill.\
Some just for showing and some just to breed\
And some just for loving, they all fill a need.\
\
Late evening is awful, you scream and you shout\
At the cats on the sofa, who refuse to get up.\
The cats and the cat shows, the travel, the thrills\
The work and the worry, the pressure, the bills.\
\
The Whole thing seems worth it, the cats are your life.\
They\'re charming and funny and offset the strife.\
Your lifestyle has changed, things just won\'t be the same.\
Yes, those cats are addictive and so is the cat game!\
