Well everybody has been full of praise for me today at work. Met a
customer and was shaken by the hand because he liked what I did so much.
Which was a relief as it was the worst design in the world to try and
copy.\
\
And then within a few minutes of that I was complimented on another
design i\`d done for a different customer. Could get used to all this
adoration for my work. A payrise and a few tips would be nice as well
though.\
\
Well [Team
Paddy](https://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teampage&teamnum=47308)
is up and running on the
[folding\@home](https://www.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/folding/)website.
So far my team consists of me, my girlfriend and my mum. It\`s turning
quite competative as my mum seems to have the edge on us!\
\
The tragic part is I upgraded their computers and now I have the slowest
computer in the family!
