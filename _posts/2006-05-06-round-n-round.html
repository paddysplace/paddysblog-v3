Urgh what a day. <br /><br />At the minute Zara is regaling me with facts about Keifer Sutherland so if this post goes off on a tangent you`ll know why!<br /><br />It`s been hot today. Too hot. I don`t like hot. It makes me tired and grouchy.<br />I suffer from vertigo. But for some strange reason my anti-deps seem to control my dizzy spells.<br />Well until today that is. It didn`t last long but it felt like a scary moment. We were at my parents and I started to feel really, really sleepy. Zara will probably tell you it`s because she was rambling on about her wonderful work day at the windmill.<br />And then...zing!<br />I get really hot, my head starts to pound and the dizzy spell hits me. It only lasted a few seconds thank God. But just for a moment I thought 'oh no, not again'<br /><br />In the bad old days it could leave me on my back for 3 days. I`m hoping it`s not coming back. It takes over my life and i`m too scared to go anywhere in case it happens again.<br />We were meant to go to Cleethorpes this afternoon. But after that I just wanted my bed. Fortunately we both felt a bit worn out and the rain had started. So we just went home.<br /><br />I hate my body controlling me. But i`m just left so helpless.
