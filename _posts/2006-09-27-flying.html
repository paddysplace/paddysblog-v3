No, not me. Time.<br />Can't believe the last time I posted was Sunday. And by the lack of comments and emails I've had I guess nobody gives a toss.<br /><br />Well, humph to to you all. I don't care cos i've got my ds lite. I currently have a brain age of 36. Although maybe that should be 6 as i'm having great fun playing Lego Star Wars.<br /><br />And...that's about it. I could rant about work I guess. Although i've just done that to Zara so it's all out my system now.<br /><br />If I think of something to complain about i'll be back!<br /><br />High: Seeing how much money we have in the bank!, yay to having 2 jobs on the go!<br />Low: The people I have to suffer at work.
