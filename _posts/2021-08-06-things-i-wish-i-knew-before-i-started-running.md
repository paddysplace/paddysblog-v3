###### Things I wish I knew before I started running
<br>
**Slow And Steady**

The worst thing I did was go off like a greyhound, and keep going until it felt like my lungs would explode. Following the couch to 5k app with a mixture of running/walking helped slow down my pace. Which brings me onto

**There's Nothing Wrong With Walking**

Unless you're trying to break a world record or get a PB then slowing down for a walk is ok. It's preferable to pushng too far and risking injury. It doesn't make you any less of a runner. It's not cheating. And there's nothing wrong with using walking and running to improve your fitness.

**Rest Days Matter**

This toook me a while to realise. In my excitement to begin my runninh journey I did way too much in the beginning. Running every moment I could, playing Ring Fit on the Nintendo Switch when I couldn't. I was putting my body through too much too soon. Which might be ok when you're younger. But at 50....not so much.

**Strength Training**

I thought all I needed to do was run. Increase my stamina. Run. Increase my strength. Run. Well turns out that wasn't the best for my muscles. Lifting weights, using resistence bands. Even yoga that helps muscle groups is all important things to consider on your running journey.

**Listen To Your Body**

The single worst thing I did was ignore my aches and pains. I thought I was just old and out of shape. The more I run the looser my muscles will become. Wrong. No pain no gain. Doubly wrong. I was soon off work with a [torn meniscus](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/meniscus-tear-injury "torn meniscus"). Weeks of rest and weeks of physio and I'm finally back running. But i'm wary of pushing myself.

**Never Compare**

The one contributing factor to my injury was getting a fitbit, uploading my times to fitbit and strava and seeing how my times stacked up to others. When I saw my pace was slower than a turtle in peanut butter then I pushed myself. Too hard. So remember:

_"Comparison Is The Thief Of Joy"_ - Theodore Roosevelt

**Drink Plenty of Water**

Dehydration negatively affects your running performance and slows your ability to recover. It increases muscle fatigue and exhaustion. Drinking before a run is so so important. Drink when you're thirsty. Seems like an obvious thing to say. 

“Feeling thirsty happens after you are dehydrated,” explains Dr. Martha Pyron, MD of [**Medicine in Motion**](https://medinmotion.com/). “You should try to prevent feeling thirsty.”

**Wear The Right Shoes**

* Do your feet ache after a run, feeling numbness?
* You can’t get your shoes off without completely loosening the laces
* After a long run, your arches ache, your Achilles-tendon is tender, and/or you feel strain in your calves
* Numbness or strain on the top of your foot
* Your toes burn after a run

Chances are you aren't wearing suitable shoes. Those ratty old trainers aren't doing your feet any favours. I ended up going to a dedicates running shop. They analysed my running style and picked out a pair of running shoes. And they've been my best investment yet in my running journey.


#### So What did I learn?
<br>
Don't try to do too much too soon. Listen to your what your body is telling you. Don't try to run through the pain. The risk of injury is very real. Try and get proper running shoes as soon as possible. And run for yourself. You can't run too slow. But you can run too fast and risk injury. And stay hydrated!

And try to run for fun. Your body will thank you.
