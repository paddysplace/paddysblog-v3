\-\-- Ok, i\`m weak. I couldn\`t take going cold turkey anymore!\
\
So now here I am in a nice hot bath with my laptop and several metres of
network cable trailing between it and my router.\
I\`m connected again. Sigh.\
\
Although the connection does keep crapping out every so many minutes.
But that could be either my crappy laptop or crappy ethernet cable.\
\
So what\`s wrong with Mondays then?\
\
Well apart from it being the start of another crappy week.\
And apart from it means i\`m another day older, and another day nearer
being 36!\
\
Umm, nothing really.\
\
Although the day did go slightly downhill when my work van broke in an
alarming way. Fortunately I wasn\`t driving it, otherwise I may not be
here to tell the tale!\
\
So now i\`m without a van. And have to use my/our own car/fuel to get to
work. Damnit.\
\
One of the slight perks I get is having the satisfying thought that my
boss is paying for me to get to work.\
\
I\`m sure there\`s more I could moan about but my brain is tired and
Supernatural is on in less than 10 mins now.
