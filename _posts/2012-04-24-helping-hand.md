Ok. ~~I said this blog is dead. And so it it. Well, maybe just resting~~. Helping my dads local flying club get its new domain off the ground (ahaha) so thought I would try adding a backlink here. So here it is <a href="https://www.flyatfranks.org/">https://www.flyatfranks.org/</a> If you're in the lincolnshire area and feel like taking a trial flight to see what your house looks like from the air then check them out. Details of trial flights can be found here <a href="https://www.flyatfranks.org/trial-flight/">https://www.flyatfranks.org/trial-flight/</a> There. I`ve done my bit. This totally reads like a spam advert but it's not :)
