Go [here](https://cyborg.namedecoder.com/)to get your cyborg name. Yeah,
i\`m bored tonight.\
\
I\`m really sleepy actually. I\`m blaming the weather as both me n Zara
have had no energy the past couple of days. Just can\`t seem to get
motivated. And then today at work Rob said he felt the same! So it\`s
either that or they\`re putting something in our water up here.\
\
I don\`t think it helped that halfway through the week our boss decided
to piss us off by informing us we cant\` use the vans to go home in on
our lunch break. Yeah, that would have been fine if he\`d laid down the
ground rules when we first started taking the vans home.\
\
I swear he just sits in his office thinking off ways to wind us up. It
bloody works whatever he does. Anyway, i\`m still using the van. It was
the lamest of reasons he used for us not using them. And until we\`re
provided with a canteen then he has little choice but to let us.\
\
Well the bath panel arrived today. Looks great, no marks, no scratches,
doesn\`t fit\...arrghh!. So we have to \'modify\' some of Rod\`s
workwork. Other than that. It looks really good.\
\
Well, i\`ll leave you with what we are often faced with when trying to
get into bed. It\`s not as scary as it looks. He hides under the duvet
whenever he gets scared. Like when the binmen come round.\
