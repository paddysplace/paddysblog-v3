\-\-- A girl came skipping home from school one day.\
\"Mummy, Mummy,\" she yelled, \"we were counting today, and all the
other\
kids\
could only count to 4, but I counted to 10.\
See? 1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8,9,10!\"\
\"Very good,\" said her mother.\
\"Is it because I\'m blonde, Mummy?\"\
\"Yes, it\'s because you\'re blonde,\" her mother replied.\
The next day, the girl came skipping home from school.\
\"Mummy, Mummy,\" she yelled, \"we were saying the alphabet today, and
all\
the\
other kids could only say it to D, but I said it to G.\
See? A, B, C, D, E, F, G!\"\
\"Very good,\" said her mother.\
\"Is it because I\'m blonde, Mummy?\"\
\"Yes, pumpkin, it\'s because you\'re blonde.\"\
The next day the girl came skipping home from school.\
\"Mummy, Mummy,\" she yelled, \"we were in gym class today, and when we\
showered, all the other girls had flat chests, but I have these!\"\
And she lifted her tank top to reveal a pair of 36Cs.\
\"Very good,\" said her embarrassed mother.\
\"Is it because I\'m blonde, Mummy?\"\
\"No \... it\'s because you\'re 25.\"
