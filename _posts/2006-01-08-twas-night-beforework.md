\-\-- Arrghh!\
\
Back to normal tomorrow. I knew it all had to come to an end. But damn
it\...just another week sitting around watching tv all day wouldn\`t
hurt!\
\
Well, not quite a normal day tomorrow as it\`s my gf\`s birthday. Got
all the presents to wrap yet.\
\
Been attempting to make a cake for her, under her supervision of
course\...the kitchen is completely not my domain anymore. And i\`ve
made a card that i\`m quite pleased with.\
\
She\`s the creative one. Cake decorating, card making, present making,
photography. She\`s just way over talented in all these things. Still.
Ask her to click in the menu bar on her pc and she\`s lost. So there\`s
hope for me yet.\
\
Not looking forward to tomorrow. I\`ve managed to avoid the outside
world (other than going shopping and visiting family) up until now. Just
been in my own little cocoon. Well, me, my gf, 2 cats, 3 guinea pigs and
a rat. So it\`s not that little a cocoon.\
\
So my usual mundane ramblings will soon be replaced with mucho ranting
about my workplace\...I bet you can hardly wait!
