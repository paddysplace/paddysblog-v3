Being British is about driving in a German car to an Irish pub for a Belgian beer, then travelling home, grabbing an Indian curry or a Turkish kebab on the way, to sit on Swedish furniture and watch American shows on a Japanese TV. And the most British thing of all? Suspicion of anything foreign.<br /><br />Only in Britain...<br /> <br />...can a pizza get to your house faster than an ambulance.<br /><br />...do supermarkets make sick people walk all the way to the back of the shop to get their prescriptions - while healthy people can buy cigarettes at the front.<br /><br />...do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries and a DIET coke.<br /><br />...do banks leave both doors open and chain the pens to the counters.<br /><br />...do we leave cars worth thousands of pounds on the drive and lock our junk and cheap lawn mower in the garage.<br /><br />...do we use answering machines to screen call and then have call waiting so we won't miss a call from someone we didn't want to talk to in the first place.<br /><br />...are there disabled parking places in front of a skating rink.<br /><br />NOT TO MENTION...<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">3</span> Brits die each year testing if a 9v battery works on their tongue.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">142</span> Brits were injured in 1999 by not removing all pins from new shirts.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">58</span> Brits are injured each year by using sharp knives instead of screwdrivers. <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">19</span> Brits have died in the last 3 years believing that Christmas decorations were chocolate. British Hospitals reported <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">4</span> broken arms last year after cracker pulling accidents. <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">101</span> people since 1999 have had broken parts of plastic toys pulled out of the soles of their feet.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">18</span> Brits had serious burns in 2000 trying on a new jumper with a lit cigarette in their mouth.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">543</span> Brits were admitted to A&E in the last two years after opening bottles of beer with their teeth. <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">5</span> Brits were injured last year in accidents involving out of Control Scalextric cars. <br /><br />and finally.........<br />In 2000 eight Brits cracked their skull whilst throwing up into the toilet.<br /><br />I am proud to be British
