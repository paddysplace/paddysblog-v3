getting into the halloween spirit. Girlfriend is busy hollowing out
pumpkins for me to annihilate attempting to carve a spooky face onto it.
Got a (hopefully) scary film to watch as well.\
\
Got fireworks going off all over the place. I hate fireworks. Well, I
hate them for our animal\`s sake. Scares the crap out of our two cats.
The whole bonfire night tends to pass me by to be honest. I think it
gets further and further away from the actual meaning as the years go
by. I\`m all for organised bonfire parties. But I reckon they should not
sell fireworks to the general public. If nothing else it\`ll stop little
fuckers shoving lighted ones into cats mouths and other such horrific
things.\
\
Got the first bit of Christmas shopping done. Bought a Budweiser gift
set for my girlfriend\`s sister\`s husband. Bud tastes like nats piss to
me so it\`ll be safe until we can give it to him.
