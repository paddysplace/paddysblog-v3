\-\-- Well it\`s getting late and i\`m tired so I wasn\`t going to post
anything tonight until Zara said \'you haven\`t written
anything\'\...\'you\`ve been in the bath\'\...\'you always write
something when you\`re in the bath\'.\
\
So here it is.\
\
My post bath post, heh.\
\
I guess all I can say is bathrooms! i\`m sick of seeing bathrooms.
Talking bathrooms. Bathroom wallpaper, bathroom tiles, bathroom
flooring, bathroom accessories.\
\
Yes, we have started the redecorating, redesigning and anything else
beginning in \'re\' of the bathroom.\
\
Spent most of yesterday with girlfriend and mother going round Ikea. My
mum has never been before so it was like taking a kiddie round a toy
store.\
\
So did we buy anything? yes\...a shower curtain.\
\
At least it was a cheap(ish) shopping trip. Went with a list of about 30
things and ended up buying about 3.\
\
So today was spent going round diy stores picking out tiles and flooring
and wallpaper. Decisions were made, choices were chosen. And after
yo-yoing between B&Q, Homebase and Focus we found the optimum
combination of tile, wallpaper and floor tile.\
\
So i\`ve been ripping old tiles off the wall, which is great for stress
relief. And as all DIY projects go it all ended in a falling out between
me and Zara.\
\
But all is well again in Paddy Towers. One wall is tile free, I even
cleaned up after my destruction.\
\
So now all I have to do is go through that another 3 times before we can
start taking out the old bath, sink and toilet. Assuming the new suite
gets delivered!\
\
I\`m going to work tomorrow for a rest!
