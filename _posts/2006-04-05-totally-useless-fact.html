Ok, this only works if you write the date as MM/DD/YY<br /><br />Today at two minutes and three seconds after 1:00 in<br />the morning (and at 1:00 in the afternoon), the time and date will be 01:02:03 04/05/06.<br /><br />That won't happen again until 2106 (you may not be around to see it)....<br /><br />We who write the date as DD/MM/YY have to wait until 4th May to..er..celebrate this useless fact.
