Yahoo news reads: [\"Yahoo news is reporting that the great works of
literature often read and discussed by the brighter of our up-and-comers
could be the latest victim of reaching the lowest common denominator at
the potential expense of everyone. The article describes the efforts of
Dot Mobile to make such literary masterpieces as Hamlet and Romeo and
Juliet more accessible. From the article, \'We are confident that our
version of \'text\' books will genuinely help thousands of students
remember key plots and quotes, and raise up educational standards rather
than decrease levels of literacy,\'\"]{style="font-style:italic;"}
