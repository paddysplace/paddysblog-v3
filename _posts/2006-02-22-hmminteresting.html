Ok, so i`m running late. I need to wash my hair and get out the bath before Stargate starts and my mind is blank.<br /><br />So here for your enjoyment are some facts :)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Females learn to talk earlier, use sentences earlier, and learn to read more quickly than males.<br /><br />35% of the people using personal ads for dating are already married!<br /><br />The faster a kangaroo hops, the less energy it burns!<br /><br />The word 'gymnasium' comes from the Greek word gymnazein which means 'to exercise naked.'<br /><br />Wearing yellow makes you look bigger on camera; green, smaller.<br /><br />In Japan, it is completely acceptable to name your child “Buttocks” or “Prostitute”!<br /><br />A full-grown bear can run as fast as a horse.<br /><br />A species of earthworm in Australia grows up to 10 feet in length.<br /><br />Most car horns honk in the key of 'F'.</span><br /><br />There you go fact fans. I`ll not make any comment on the first fact due to personal safety reasons.
