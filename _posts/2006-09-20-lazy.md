\-\-- No other excuse for it really. No funny posts, no cute videos.
Even worse. No Cake Tuesday!\
\
And just because I couldn\'t really be arsed. Lethargy has really set
in. I haven\'t been playing any pc games either.\
\
So what is the cause of all this? No idea.\
So what have I been doing with my time? Even less of an idea\
\
I\'m laid here, as always, in the bath; trying to think what i\'ve done
with myself since my last post. My mind is blank. Although that could be
put down to the fact I have the worst memory in the world.\
\
As a workmate so crudely put it; \'i\'d forget my balls if they weren\'t
in a bag\'\
\
Ick.\
\
So i\'m buying a Nintendo DS and that brain training game in a bid to
jolly my little grey cells into action. Well, that\'s my excuse to get a
new toy.\
\
By this time next week i\'ll have the brain of a twentysomething.\
\
No comments on the state of my body please. Yes, i\'m looking at you
Zara!\

Low: Hearing a workmate had fallen from a roof headfirst.\
High: Later hearing he\'d gotten away with a few scratches.
