\-\-- Yes, I\`m 10 years old.\
\
Last month, on the 7th September 1996 I made my first ever impression on
the internet. On a pet newsgroup.\
And then again on the 8th in the same thread as I buggered up my first
post.\
\
Sigh.\
\
I have gotten slightly better since then. Can\`t believe it\`s been 10
years. Slightly over maybe as my first foray into the online world was
through Compuserve on my dad\`s blisteringly quick 486.\
\
Then I managed to talk my (then) wife into getting connected with a
14,400 modem. On my Amiga. Good times.\
\
A lot has changed in the last 10 years. More than I thought possible.
I\'m gonna have to dig out some old photos from 10 years ago.\
\
See if i\`ve changed as well.
