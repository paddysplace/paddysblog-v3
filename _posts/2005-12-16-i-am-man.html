Ok, so am i`m wondering if i`m normal. <br /><br />Maybe it`s a stereotypical comment to make about women taking long soaks in the bath. But is it normal for a man to like taking long baths. <br /><br />No bubbles tho! <br />and no Kenny G on low in the background!<br /><br />Ok, so I have candles. But that`s only because i`m too lazy to change the lightbulb. I am in here with a glass of Jack Daniels and I am playing on my laptop, so that has to be at least a couple of man points in my favour.
