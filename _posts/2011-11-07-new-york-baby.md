\-\-- We said goodbye to Connecticut and hello to NYC. Hire car
returned, two hours on the train and we were in the big apple! It\'s
big, loud and amazing. Three hour boat cruise followed by fantastic
nighttime views of New York at the top of the Empire State Building. A
long but very exciting day.
