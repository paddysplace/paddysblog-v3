Yes it's that time of the week again.<br /><br />Although I am getting kinda lazy and letting Zara pic which cake to put up on a Tuesday. But with my terrible memory that's kind of a good thing as i'd probably keep rotating the same half dozen cakes over n over.<br /><br />Anyway, here's Shaggy and Scooby which she did for a friends' lads birthday. I think. Although I may be wrong on that.<br /><br />Be comforted in the knowledge that all you get is the cake picture and don't have to put up with my dodgy impression of Shaggy...<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/Scooby%20doo%20and%20Shaggy%20cake.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/Scooby%20doo%20and%20Shaggy%20cake.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />...rooby rooby rooo!
