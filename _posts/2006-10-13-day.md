A heart of gold stopped beating\
two shining eyes at rest.\
God broke our hearts to prove,\
He only takes the best.\
God knows you had to leave us,\
but you did not go alone-\
for part of us went with you,\
the day He took you home.\
To some you are forgotten,\
to others just part of the past,\
but to those of us who loved and lost you,\
the memory will always last.
