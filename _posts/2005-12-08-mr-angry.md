https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2005/12/mr-angry.html \-\-- Ok, i
admit it. I\`m not the calmest person in the world today. I\`m not
handling my girlfriends mood swings at all well today. I\`m not handling
people well today. I just wish they\`d all fuck off sometimes.\
\
I feel calm in myself, but as soon as anybody says anything I can feel
the blood surging! Probably isn\`t helped by the fact I listened to Rage
Against the Machine, Slipknot and other tranquil type bands today.\
\
I just feel the need to rage\
Feel I need something to break.\
\
My Sip ATA box broke today when I was doing my damndest to try and save
some money on our electric bill. Long story. Won\`t rant about it now.\
\
And the only time anybody felt like talking to me today was to try and
sort their pc problems out.\
\
I need a break from humanity.
