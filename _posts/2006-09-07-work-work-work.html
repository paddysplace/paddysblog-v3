I feel old. I ache. I`ve worked 11 hours today and it feels like 20.<br /><br />And I know what that pretty much feels like. 11 hours isn't the longest I've worked. But it's not something I choose to do.<br /><br />I don't mind working for a living. But i'll be buggered if i'm living for work.<br /><br />So now i'm laid in the bath resting my weary bones watching the countdown on my laptops' battery slowly tick down the minutes until it reaches zero then goes to sleep.<br /><br />I know how it feels.<br /><br />But I finally got and old pc set up as a file server running Linux.<br />And i've learnt a few more French words.<br /><br />So yay me.<br /><br />I'm sure all this wonderful new information will leak out my ears when i'm sleeping tonight though.
