Going to attempt to get through this post rant free. <a href="http://www.jmw500.blogspot.com/">Gemmak </a>got more of a response from my post that I did! Fortunately it was from like minded people. <br /><br />I was kind of sad noticing how many visitors I had since posting the article and how little response I got, both on here and on newsvine. Looks like apathy is alive and well on the blogosphere. Urgh, I do hate that word. But thank you to <a href="http://www.jmw500.blogspot.com/">Gemmak </a>for voting for me.<br /><br />Well someone else seeded the article from a different site and it looks like it`s heading towards the frontpage. And is getting a lot of feedback.<br /><br />So onto other things.<br /><br />Well, i`m tired. Not as tired as last night. But that`s mainly because I haven`t had to drive to Mansfield and back to pick up a damn window frame. Yeah, we`re so organised I could just cry...phhft!<br /><br />Still the boss and his royal wife are on the first of there 4 holidays they`ll take this year next week so at least the place will run a bit smoother.<br /><br />Anyway, enough grumbling. See that thing just below my banner? thats my cloud! my tagcloud...well, zoomcloud.<br /><br />No, I don`t know if I like it there either but it was something new I could sign up for and clog my blog up with. Just click on a word that sounds interesting and it`ll show you all the posts where I used that word! Clever stuff.<br /><br />Although I must apologise to <a href="http://celenaszoo.blogspot.com/">Celena </a>whose name is unfortunately next to the word bitch!...the 2 words are totally <br />unconnected ;)<br /><br />And finally...stay away from Galaxy Promises. Eating a full bar of the stuff makes your tum a bit queezy. <br /><br />Believe me<br /><br />I know
