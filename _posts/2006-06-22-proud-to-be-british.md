Being British is about driving in a German car to an Irish pub for a
Belgian beer, then travelling home, grabbing an Indian curry or a
Turkish kebab on the way, to sit on Swedish furniture and watch American
shows on a Japanese TV. And the most British thing of all? Suspicion of
anything foreign.\
\
Only in Britain\...\
\
\...can a pizza get to your house faster than an ambulance.\
\
\...do supermarkets make sick people walk all the way to the back of the
shop to get their prescriptions - while healthy people can buy
cigarettes at the front.\
\
\...do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries and a DIET coke.\
\
\...do banks leave both doors open and chain the pens to the counters.\
\
\...do we leave cars worth thousands of pounds on the drive and lock our
junk and cheap lawn mower in the garage.\
\
\...do we use answering machines to screen call and then have call
waiting so we won\'t miss a call from someone we didn\'t want to talk to
in the first place.\
\
\...are there disabled parking places in front of a skating rink.\
\
NOT TO MENTION\...\

[101]{style="font-weight:bold;"} people since 1999 have had broken parts

two years after opening bottles of beer with their teeth.\
[5]{style="font-weight:bold;"} Brits were injured last year in accidents
