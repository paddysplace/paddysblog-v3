feel old. I ache. I\`ve worked 11 hours today and it feels like 20.\
\
And I know what that pretty much feels like. 11 hours isn\'t the longest
I\'ve worked. But it\'s not something I choose to do.\
\
I don\'t mind working for a living. But i\'ll be buggered if i\'m living
for work.\
\
So now i\'m laid in the bath resting my weary bones watching the
countdown on my laptops\' battery slowly tick down the minutes until it
reaches zero then goes to sleep.\
\
I know how it feels.\
\
But I finally got and old pc set up as a file server running Linux.\
And i\'ve learnt a few more French words.\
\
So yay me.\
\
I\'m sure all this wonderful new information will leak out my ears when
i\'m sleeping tonight though.
