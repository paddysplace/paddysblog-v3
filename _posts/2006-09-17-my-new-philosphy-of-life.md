\-\-- Taken from a comment on digg, which isn\`t the important bit
really. But anyway. A short conversation between Norm & Cliff from tv\`s
Cheers.\
\
I shall now live by these wise words.\
\
["Well you see, Norm, it's like this... A herd of buffalo can only move
as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the
slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural
selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and
health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the
weakest members.\
\
In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the
slowest brain cells. Now, as we know, excessive intake of alcohol kills
brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain
cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the
weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster more efficient machine.\
\
And that, Norm, is why you always feel smarter after a few
beers."]{style="font-style:italic;"}
