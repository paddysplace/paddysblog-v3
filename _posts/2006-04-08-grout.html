Not sure I should be posting anything here tonight as everything is against me.<br /><br />I`m tired<br />I`m drinking Glenfiddich<br />I`m in the bath, with the lights out cos we have no curtains up and I don`t really want the neighbours seeing me naked<br />The room is full of paint fumes<br /><br />So if I start talking about the pretty pink elephants flying round the room you`ll know why.<br /><br />All things considered I`m in quite a good mood. I was up early doing the grouting in the bathroom. Now have to spend tomorrow scraping all the excess off.<br /><br />Me. Up early. At the weekend. Doing DIY for fraks sake!<br /><br />My ex wife would turn in her grave if i`d had the chance to do away with her and put her under the patio.<br /><br />Ahem..<br /><br />I`m turning more into a geek as time goes on. I`ve been using Ubunto pretty much all the time on both my laptop and main pc. As soon as they find a way to use Itunes in it, and play games then i`ll be there full time!<br /><br />Although I don`t play games that much now. Maybe I AM getting old. I used to be able to sit up until 4am playing Civilisation on my Amiga night after night. But now. barely 2 hours can pass and I need a break. Or Zara is trying to get me to join the real world for something dull and ordinary...like eating!<br /><br />Anyway, time for a gripe. <br /><br />The one thing that hacks me off more than anything when I`m online is Instant Messaging.<br /><br />Not the actual act of instant messaging. But the times went people don`t message you back, It really fucks me off when I send a message saying hi and don`t get a reply.<br /><br />I don`t mean the times when people are marked as away or busy. But the times they`re just sat there. And several minutes later they log off. <br /><br />Now i`m thinking. They know i`m here. They have a message from me. And they just go. Just a quick hi n bye isn`t much to ask for. It`s just plain rude if you ask me. Maybe they just don`t feel like chatting. Or don`t feel like chatting to me...fine. But don`t just fucking snub me and log off thinking I won`t notice.<br /><br />Ok, I know I shouldn`t take it personal. But I tend to behave online like I do in real life. Which is probably kind of scary. Well, I mean I`m not rude, or ignore people or anything. You wouldn`t do it if someone you knew came up to you in the street and said hi and you just kept walking.<br /><br />Maybe it`s the whisky winding me up. So I`ll leave it there before my blood pressure gets too high!<br /><br />In the great scheme of things it`s not a major problem. But in the here and now it pisses me off.<br /><br />Damnit, I hate ending on a sour note.<br /><br />So...umm....fluffy puppies!<br /><br />There, that`s better.
