\-\-- It\`s cold. It\`s way too cold. I\`m tweaking the nose of fate and
tickling the balls of stupidity by laying here in a nice hot bath with
the lil gas heater on the setting marked \'blast furnace\' and typing
away on my laptop.\
\
But I don\`t care. I\`m warm. I\`m toasty. I can feel my extremities -
stop sniggering at the back there! I\`m even looking forward to getting
out the bath because the towel is nicely smoldering in front of the
heater.\
\
All of the above could have been nicely summed up in one line.\
\
[I don\`t like the cold]{style="font-weight:bold;"}.\
\
And in less than 15 minutes now i\`ll be sat infront of the tv watching
Stargate with a big plateful of pancakes.\
\
So that\`s all you\`re gonna get out of me tonight. No long ramblings.
No deep and insightful post on the inner working of Paddy.\
\
Because right now all I can think about is pancakes.\
\
Sigh. Why can\`t everything in life be as simple.\
\
[And just to prove I haven\`t been totally lazy. I had a quick mess
about creating a webpage in google pages. My masterpiece can be viewed
