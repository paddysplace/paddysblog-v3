Well it`s been a day of bathroom fun again.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/Image015.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/Image015.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Shelves and cupboards are on the list of things to do this weekend. I`m getting pretty good with the ol` cordless drill and making nice neat holes in the tiles.<br /><br />So as I lounge here in the bath this is the view I get of our nice, slowly becoming organised, bathroom. It might look a little blurry but I like my bath hot!<br /><br />So it`s cupboards tomorrow then the floor to do. Then finally.<br /><br />Finally.<br /><br />We`ll be finished!!<br /><br />Then it`s my birthday. Which I really am doing quite badly at hinting about I think.<br /><br />6 days to go people.
