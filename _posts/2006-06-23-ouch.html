Damn, I should be getting ready for work!<br /><br />Anyway, just had to blog this for the benefit of my girlfriend. Her hatred for MotoGP rider Rossi knows no bounds, lol. And as her fave rider Sete Gibernau won`t be riding at Donnington when we go I thought this would give her some joy.<br /><br />Still, looked quite a nasty crash.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/KwSEZCeK0qU"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/KwSEZCeK0qU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>
