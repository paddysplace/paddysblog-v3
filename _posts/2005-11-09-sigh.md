\-\-- Three days after bonfire night and the plebs are still setting
fireworks off. Don\`t they get bored of them! I never did the see the
attraction of them. Even when I was younger.\

Been doing my best not to get too addicted to
[Blogthing](https://www.blogthings.com/). Doing well so far and only
posted one result of a quiz so far, but i\`m sure more will follow. I
also really need a faster net connection 1Mb connection with a 3Gb cap
seemed more than enough at one point. But the faster I surf the more
things I find to download. And if all my favourite podcasts go video
which they seem to be doing then I\`m gonna hit 3Gb in a day let alone a
month.\

Discussed ways to save money on the electric bill with my girlfriend and
am going to give a concerted effort in a bid to knock our electric usage
down. It\`s just so easy to plug more and more things in and leave them
plugged in without realising they\`re using power. In the computer room
alone we have three 8 plug multisockets, all full! 24 things plugged in
and running nearly 24/7!!! I\`m surprised the house doesn\`t glow.
