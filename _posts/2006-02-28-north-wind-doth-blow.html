It`s cold. It`s way too cold. I`m tweaking the nose of fate and tickling the balls of stupidity by laying here in a nice hot bath with the lil gas heater on the setting marked 'blast furnace' and typing away on my laptop.<br /><br />But I don`t care. I`m warm. I`m toasty. I can feel my extremities - stop sniggering at the back there! I`m even looking forward to getting out the bath because the towel is nicely smoldering in front of the heater.<br /><br />All of the above could have been nicely summed up in one line.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">I don`t like the cold</span>.<br /><br />And in less than 15 minutes now i`ll be sat infront of the tv watching Stargate with a big plateful of pancakes.<br /><br />So that`s all you`re gonna get out of me tonight. No long ramblings. No deep and insightful post on the inner working of Paddy.<br /><br />Because right now all I can think about is pancakes.<br /><br />Sigh. Why can`t everything in life be as simple.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">And just to prove I haven`t been totally lazy. I had a quick mess about creating a webpage in google pages.
