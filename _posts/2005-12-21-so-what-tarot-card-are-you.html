<img src="http://images.quizilla.com/K/Koshari/1072669034_otTheTower.jpg" border="0" alt="The Tower Card"><br>You are the Tower card. The Tower represents a<br>sudden, drastic change. This change can be<br>incredibly freeing. It can be a change in the<br>way you think, or a change in environment. The<br>physical body may be healed of a long illness<br>in a seemingly miraculous way. Dramatic change<br>may lead you into a completely different career<br>or lifestyle. On the negative side of things,<br>you may suddenly lose your fortune or have an<br>experience that shatters your sense of<br>identity. The Tower that crumbles under the<br>lightning bolt is the physical and may be<br>indicative of some aspect of your physical<br>world. But as the Tower crumbles it reveals a<br>sturdier foundation, something which perhaps<br>you did not expect but which, nevertheless,<br>arrives fully formed and strong into your life.<br>Image from: The Ibis Tarot deck<br>http://www.astroamerica.com/t-ibis.html<br /><br><br><a href="http://quizilla.com/users/Koshari/quizzes/Which%20Tarot%20Card%20Are%20You%3F/"> Which Tarot Card Are You?</a><BR> <font size="-2">brought to you by <a href="http://quizilla.com">Quizilla</a></font><br /><a href="http://www.astroamerica.com/t-ibis.html"></a>
