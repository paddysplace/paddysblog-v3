I have to type quick tonight.<br />I`m under pressure.<br />Not only does Supernatural start in less than 5 mins now but if I don`t write anything then I don`t think Zara will let me get into bed.<br /><br />You`d think we don`t talk to each other.<br />She likes to get her daily dose of Paddy`s Prattling.<br />And this from the woman who lives with me!<br /><br />Ok, so if this post of prattling is full of typos and makes less sense than usual then you`ll understand why.<br /><br />So where does the Fame & Success come from in today`s title. In another fit of full on nerdyness I got slightly excited (not THAT excited) when I heard my voice talking to me from my Ipod. <br /><br />Yes my voicemail concerning Skype with Ubuntu was played in the MikeTechShow podcast. Yay. He even answered my query and commented on my 3 previous failed calls to his voicemail line whilst trying to use Skype under Ubuntu.<br /><br />Anyway, the problem is half solved...if anybody cares!<br /><br />Next on the list is getting my Ipod to talk nicely with Ubuntu.<br /><br />So there you go. Not exactly earthshattering. Not gonna win me any prizes or get my name up in lights. But in my own little way it made me smile.<br /><br />I know. I`m sad.<br /><br />Supernatural will be on in a minute, Zara will want to read my waffling and then the world will be a happy place again.
