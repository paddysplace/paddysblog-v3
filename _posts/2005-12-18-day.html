I`m sat here feeling kinda detatched from the world.<br />I think it`s the deer in the water, helpless as their surroundings are consumed.<br /><br />It`s like a switch has been flipped inside me. <br /><br />I`ve been sat here trying to think how to spend the day. Yesterday I was feeling fine. I build today up so much I end up not knowing how to get through it.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.stambaughfamily.com/montanafire_3_adj2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.stambaughfamily.com/montanafire_3_adj2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />So I surfed the web a bit, checked ebay for last minute gifts, read my bloglines rss feeds. And came across this pic from a website. I don`t know why, but it seems to sum up how I feel at the minute.<br /><br />My stomach knots up and I feel a lump in my throat as I look at the deer. Wishing I could help them, feeling their fear. I empathise far too much.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/emmdnchoc.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/400/emmdnchoc.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Happy Birthday David. <br /><br />I miss you.
