i\`m angry, i\`m arsey..i\`m seriously pissed off.\
\
This was going to be a rant about work\...but after watching celebrity
big brother I really have to get this out my system.\
\
Pete Burns needs to get his big disfigured fucking face from up his own
arse and stop spouting the fucking scouse fucking bollocks that comes
out his balloon sized lips.\
\
He\`s not the only freak in their, but the only one I want to take a
crowbar to! And I don\`t even want to get started on Galloway and
Barrymore!\
\
Ok, I feel better now\...i\`m calm\....well, about BB anyway.\
\
Now, work. Ah yes. The wonderful place of employment. I\`ve only been
back 2 days and i\`m ready for another holiday.\
\
Got our pay yesterday and found out that we didn\`t get paid for the
full day the last Friday we worked. Now the past 3 years i\`ve been
there we finish at 12 (but pays us for a full day) on the last day and
all go for a Christmas piss up.\
\
Not this year. Our boss (again, as last year) generously put £300 behind
the bar for drinks for all of us.\
\
Then manages to make that £300 back by not paying us for a full day. So
basically we bought our own Christmas drinks.\
\
Merry Fucking Christmas.\
\
Now, if this happened year after year I wouldn\`t have a problem with
it. But we knew nothing about it. Had no say in the matter and didn\`t
find out until yesterday.\
\
People are pissed off to say the least.\
\
So no christmas bonus, no party, vans are breaking down, no pay rise as
promised last October and a million other little things that just make
the day to day job just that little bit more stressful.\
\
Time for a job hunt this year methinks.
