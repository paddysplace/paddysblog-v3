Well thank you Branson and Murdoch. I guess having billions of pounds doesn't mean you're gonna be less of a dickhead.<br /><br />In the war between content providers the casualties are the customers. I knew it was gonna happen. But I switched the tv on this morning hoping that Sky One was still gonna be there.<br /><br />But no.<br /><br />So fuck you Sky. I'm not gonna be the donkey that you dangle the carrot infront of and follow you mindlessly to become a Sky customer. I'll take my chances with Virgin and see what they can offer without the crutch that is Sky.<br /><br />I'll miss watching new episodes of Lost, Battlestar Galactica, Bones and others. But my life will go on without them. Even if it means waiting until later in the year to watch them I somehow think i'll live.
