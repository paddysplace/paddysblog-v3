Woo, downloaded and listened to couple of podcasts this morning, including <a href="http://www.miketechshow.com/">The Mike Tech Show</a>. He gave a shoutout to me about the message I left him on skype!...woo. Ok, so it`s not gonna set me on the road to stardom but it was a cool moment :)<br /><br />Nothing exciting to tell. Had a lazy day, some of my stuff seems to be selling on ebay, so that`ll be a few pennies for Christmas. Trying not to spend too much this year as we bought a new car and have to be careful with the money, so i`m trying novel new ways to  get Christmas presents without spending too much. All legal of course! <a href="http://www.pigsback.com">Pigsback</a> is one such site where you can earn points towards vouchers, online surveys is another altho that takes a while to earn enough money to be worthwile. So I resort to selling stuff that`s been gathering dust for a while on ebay.<br /><br />Really want to buy 2 more pet rats. We went to the pet shop yesterday and they had 2 really cute looking little girls. They were housed on sawdust which is terrible for their respiration. One was sneezing some and I nearly bought them on the spot. But we haven`t really got the room for them. It broke my heart walking out of there without them and I haven`t been able to stop worrying about them since.<br /><br />Keep telling myself I can`t save every animal, doesn`t help though.
