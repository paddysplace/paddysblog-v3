[The following mind-boggling attempt at a crime spree in Washington, DC
appeared to be the robber\'s first (and last), due to his lack of a
previous record of violence, and his terminally stupid choices:\
\
1. His target was H&J Leather & Firearms, A gun shop specializing in
handguns.\
\
2. The shop was full of customers - firearms customers.\
\
3. To enter the shop, the robber had to step around a marked police
patrol car parked at the front door.\
\
4. A uniformed officer was standing at the counter, having coffee before
work. Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a
hold-up,and fired a few wild shots from a target pistol. The officer and
a clerk promptly returned fire, the police officer with a 9mm Glock 17,
the clerk with a .50 Desert Eagle, assisted by several customers who
also drew their guns, several of whom also fired. The robber was
pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Crime scene investigators
located 47 expended cartridge cases in the shop. The subsequent autopsy
revealed 23 gunshot wounds. Ballistics identified rounds from 7
different weapons. No one else was hurt in the exchange of fire.\

Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt (Paderborn, Germany) fed his
constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a
bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm
finally let it fly, and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop!\
\
Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the
ailing elephant an olive oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on
him. \"The sheer force of the elephant\'s unexpected defecation knocked
Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he struck his head on a rock and lay
unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top of
him\" said flabbergasted Paderborn police detective Erik Dern. With no
one there to help him, he lay under all that dung for at least an hour
before a watchman came along. During that time he suffocated.\
\
It seems to be just one of those freak accidents that proves that \"Sh!t
happens!\"]{style="font-style:italic;"}
