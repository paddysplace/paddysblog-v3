Ok, I think Zara has been going on about bathrooms for so long it`s started to affect me. Not sure I should be blogging this as she`s bound to want it.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://www.inhabitat.com/images/hansa4.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px;" src="https://www.inhabitat.com/images/hansa4.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Anyway, according to <a href="https://www.inhabitat.com/entry_236.php">this sites</a> blurb these tap systems <span style="font-style:italic;">"also feature temperature sensitive LEDs lining the walls of the canyon, which illuminate the water in different colors depending on the temperature of the water"</span><br /><br />I think they`re pretty cool...which has me even more worried!
