\-\-- Beware, this sounds bad.\
\
I\'m not usually one for posting warnings about scams but I had a near
miss the other day.\
I walked into B&Q for my \'daily\' visit and some old guy, dressed all
in orange, asked me if I wanted decking.\
\
Fortunately, I got the first punch in and that was the end of that.\
\
Those less suspecting might not be so lucky - be on your guard.
