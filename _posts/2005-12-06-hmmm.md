\-\-- Ok, i\`m bored. I\`ve got nothing to say. I\`ve read through my
rss feeds for my fave sites like [digg.com](https://www.digg.com/) and
[slashdot.org](https://slashdot.org/) for anything interesting to share
with my dear reader\...er\...readers. And can\`t find anything that
isn\`t way too nerdy that it makes my girlfriends eyes cross and sigh at
me in despair, umm she sighs at me\...not her eyes!\
\
The one thing I did find I also found that gemmak blogged it so don\`t
want to feel like i\`m copying. Although it is very interesting so go
[here](https://jmw500.blogspot.com/2005/12/new-species.html) for a
read.\
\
So if anyone has any cool sites, links, articles let me know.\
\
If you still look in on my blog gemmak I hope you don\`t mind me
constantly linking to your blog! :)
