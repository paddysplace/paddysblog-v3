https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/01/turn-it-up.html \-\-- Ok,
that\`s it. I\`ve had enought of winter now. Can we turn the temperature
up a bit.\
\
I didn\`t mind when I was off work and could stay inside all day. But
now\....well it\`s just too damn cold for me. I\`m a wuss I know. But
there\`s only so many layers of clothing I can put on before any sort of
movement becomes difficult.\
\
I know it\`s not really THAT cold yet. But to my body it may as well be
the antarctic. Maybe I need better thermals. Furry underwear. At least I
have my Donnington wolly hat back after ZARA lost it down the back of
the settee ;)\
\
I think I want to be a cat. Garfield can sit outside all day on the
frozen ground and it doesn\`t seem to phase him. And after a hard day at
the office (i.e. stalking mice in the shed) this is how he spends his
evenings. Not a bad life. Yeah, I want to be a cat.\

Anybody wanna put a saucer of milk down for me and call me trixie?\
No.\
Thought not.\
Damnit.
