\-\-- I\`m wondering..what makes for an interesting blog. Other than
braless tuesday ;)\
\
Which I don\`t think i\`m really suited for.\
\
I\`m just meandering through the miriad (sp?) of blogs out there and
wonder how these people attract other people to read their stuff. I
mean, some of them are as trivial and rambly as mine. Yet have tons of
comments.\
\
I\`m guessing they have lots of online friends\...unlike Billy No Mates
here!\
\
I think i\`ve subbed to most of the blog directories. Got my blog link
on my profile pages\....oooh, except my Yahoo profile I think!\
\
And another thing. Do you find yourself reading blogs belonging to the
opposite sex? I tend to read blogs written by the female persuasion of
the opposite sex. Don\`t know why. Maybe us blokes are..well..a bit
boring.
