Damn I wish I could take and manipulate pictures like <a href="http://www.parconline.blogspot.com/">this guy</a>. My girlfriend is the whizz with the digital camera, mainly cos it`s never out of her hand.<br /><br />I just aim it at what I want to take a picture of and hope for the best. Which is a shame as I love mucking about with pictures in Photoshop. I just don`t have the patience, or talent. Although my girlfriends Mum and her new husband`s wedding video came a step closer to completion. So I guess i`m good at some things.
