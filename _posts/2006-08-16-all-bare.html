The more astute amongst you may have noticed that my blog page looks a little different. Being the sucker I am to try new things I moved my blog over to the new blogger.com beta site. <br /><br />You can't do raw HTML editing just yet so some things like my haloscan comments are missing. But the new elements you can add are really cool. So no doubt i'll be playing like mad and messing my blog up big time.<br /><br />Oooh, now how should I label this post...hmmm.
