Damn you Deanna and your \'if you grew up in the 70s\' email.\
\
I\'ve gone all dreamy of the days I grew up in a small village in the
middle of nowhere next to the river.\
\
Getting snowed in every winter and the school bus not getting through.\
\
Only 3 tv channels, and still racing home on my bike on Saturday to
watch the A Team, or the Hulk or the Dukes of Hazzard (which is being
shown on Bravo and still is damn good to watch).\
\
And despite only the 3 channels I had more tv to watch than I do with my
30+ channels; [Charlie\'s Angels, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers In
The 25th Century, The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Voyage
To The Bottom Of The Sea, Knight Rider, The A-Team, Kung Fu, CHiPs, The
Fall Guy, Street Hawk, Logan\'s Run and The Man From
Atlantis]{style="font-style:italic;"} to name a few!\
\
Going out to play with friends first thing in the morning and not coming
home until tea was ready at 5pm. And actually having to walk or ride a
bike to get anywhere.\
\
Action Man was a real hero, and not some gimp with a snowboard like he
is now. Losing the skin on my knuckles winding up the power wheel to
release Evil Knievel on his motorbike.\
\
Queuing up outside to watch Star Wars at the local cinema. And the film
shown before the \'main feature\' was about bikers/hells angels. And I
decided then that I wanted a motorbike.\
\
Never actually getting the hang of skateboarding. Despite having a cool
book with lots of pictures showing you how to \'hang 5\'\
\
Buying \'[Look In](https://www.lookinarchive.com/homepage.html)\' for
all the cool posters of bands like Boomtown Rats, Adam and his ants &
Blondie.\
\
Not even knowing what a computer was!\
\
Being able to buy sweets for half a pence.\
\
Saying flippng heck was classed as swearing.\
\
I guess everybody feels like this about the decade they grew up in. Mine
seems to span between 1976 and 1986 when I left school.\
\
Everybody\'s years are the best to them.
