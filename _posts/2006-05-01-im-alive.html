Yes i`m still here. In case any of you were wondering if I survived my birthday. <br />You know who you are ;)<br />I had a fantastic birthday. <br /><br />Got lots of great presents. Books, vouchers, alchohol, clothes, alchohol.<br />Me and Zara went to watch Silent Hill at the cinema. Yes, a nice romantic evening out.<br /><br />Then back to reality on Saturday as we attempted to not get stressed with each other as we laid the bathroom floor tiles. Which went pretty well. Only a few minor boo boos. Mainly to do with my cutting skills and tape measuring abilities.<br /><br />And yesterday we went to over to Leicester to meet Zara`s dad and his partner at <a href="https://www.leicestershire.ndirect.co.uk/FFBradgate.htm">Bradgate Park</a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0430Image0023.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0430Image0023.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0430Image0026.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0430Image0026.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0430Image0065.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0430Image0065.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0430Image0021.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0430Image0021.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0430Image0025.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0430Image0025.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Which meant for a lot of walking. A lot. So today i`m doing as little as possible. Nothin. Nadda. No bathroom. Very little walking. A relaxing day.<br /><br />Hopefully.<br /><br />The rest of the pics will be up on Flickr soon.
