\-\-- Ok, this only works if you write the date as MM/DD/YY\
\
Today at two minutes and three seconds after 1:00 in\
the morning (and at 1:00 in the afternoon), the time and date will be
01:02:03 04/05/06.\
\
That won\'t happen again until 2106 (you may not be around to see
it)\....\
\
We who write the date as DD/MM/YY have to wait until 4th May
to..er..celebrate this useless fact.
