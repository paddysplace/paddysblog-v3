are here\...ie, Zara\`s mum and Rod. We\`ve let them have our bedroom as

small folding out bed/settee. It also means i\`m closer to my computer

So here I sit on the edge of my \'bed\' with a rat sat up my dressing
gown sleeve. I\`m beginning to think the animals are the ones with the
most sense. They don\`t fill their lives with the stresses us humans
do.\
\
More to the point, they don\`t feel the need to redecorate their living
area/toilet area. Ok, so i\`m getting a little stressed about the
impending bathroom refit. This is seriously unknown territory for me and
part of me is regretting starting it.\
\
I know it\`ll be alright in the end. But it\`s that feeling of standing
on the edge of a cliff and looking down and getting that sinking feeling
that it\`s going to really really hurt.\
\
I\`m just going to go with the flow. Whatever Rod says is the right
thing to do I\`m gonna go with. Cos I don\`t have a clue. And anyway,
Zara will probably be doing enough disagreeing for the both of us.\

To pick a line from my favourite film to sum up how I feel right now.
I\`ll have to rely on Star Wars ;)\
