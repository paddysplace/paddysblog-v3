Ok, it`s official.<br /><br />I can`t do DIY. Well that`s not entirely true. I can do it up to a point.<br /><br />And that point happens to be putting cupboards up.<br /><br />And yesterday that point came crashing down. Fortunately my head broke its fall.<br /><br />Was it the wall plugs? was it the screws? who knows. But down it came. So now I have a nice lump on the top of my head. But I wasn`t going to be defeated by Ikeas finest chipboard.<br /><br />Cupboard 1 went up, and stayed. Cupboard 2 went up...and has also yet to make a bid for freedom from the wall. It looks pretty good. Would look even better if the door fram the cupboard is hanging above was level. But I`ve finally convinced myself...with help from Zara that there`s nothing I can do about that.<br /><br />So now i`m starting to hate DIY.<br />I was never that keen on it in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason people set up as  painters and decorators.<br /><br />And i`m beginning to realise that reason is me.
