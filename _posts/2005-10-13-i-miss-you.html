Testing his motorbike on a disused airfield David was in collision with a builders van speeding across the airfiled.<br /><br />My life has never really been the same since. A part of my jigsaw of life is missing and nothing I can do will ever replace it. He was my best friend as well as my brother. We had so much in common. Liked the same films, played the same pc games, rpg`s, watched the same sports.  I miss all that. Nobody can take his place where all those things are concerned.<br /><br />I thought the pain was supposed to get easier to deal with over time. It`s not.<br /><br />I miss you David.<br /><span style="font-size:8;">Posted by <a href="https://picasa.google.com/blogger/" target="ext">Picasa</a></span>
