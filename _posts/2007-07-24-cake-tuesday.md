Been a while since I posted any Cake Tuesday. As can be seen by the
numerous animals the theme of the cake is Safari! Went down to Oxford
last Thursday for the wedding which was on the Friday. And if you've
been watching anything of the news you'll know how wet it was. Rain!
don't talk about the rain! The happy couple are probably now happily
basking somewhere on the Masi Mara. Just hope it's not the rainy season
out there!
