Well as usual i've left my posting until as late as possible and now I'm being...umm, what's the word. 'Asked' if i'm getting out the bath soon.<br /><br />Someone is wanting to get tea started methinks.<br /><br />Anyhoo..my Monday has been a bit...umm. That's the best way to describe it really. Umm.<br /><br />Nothing really happened. Nothing wound me up. Nothing pissed me off. I guess nobody was awake enough this Monday to cause me grief. I'll have to watch the news later to see if anything happened.<br /><br />Maybe the rest of the world had an umm day. I'll switch on the tv and find the news reporter sleeping at their desk.<br /><br />Ok. Now, this isn't a complaint, or a moan or a gripe about the lack of comments I get. I'm rising above all that...for now anyway.<br /><br />But Zara did 'mention' that she was unable to post a comment today. Anybody else having problems? Anyone know how to get haloscan working in blogger beta?<br /><br />Email/skype or send me and odeo message of you have anything to say..those buttons are there on the right for a purpose people...use em!<br /><br />Well on that happy note I shall depart dear reader.<br /><br />Todays High: 29 on Brain Age, woo.<br />Todays Low: Bluetooth not working on my laptop, damnit.
