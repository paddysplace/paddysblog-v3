Check out the time i'm posting this!<br /><br />I'm ready to go.<br />It's like Christmas when I was a kid. Hell, it's like Christmas now! Going to bed early. Not being able to sleep. Waking up early.<br /><br />Zara kept threatening to leave me at my parents yesterday and pick me up this morning.<br />I don't get too excited.<br /><br />So the weekend has been filled with watching practice and qualifying. And now we're getting ready so we can be there for warm-up and the races.<br /><br />Food n drink are ready, the tickets are in a place where we can't forget them. The digicam and video camera batteries are fully charged.<br /><br />Time to go racing. Yay.
