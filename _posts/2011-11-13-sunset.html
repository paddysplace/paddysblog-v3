As the sun sets on the last day off our holiday, I feel a little nostalgic. <br /><br />I have the post holiday blues, the feeling that the past 2 weeks were all a dream. That reality that normal work life is fast approaching is sending all my holiday memories to the filing cabinet in my brain.<br /><br />The only thing currently stopping me from believing that this was all the dream is the 1215 photos currently downloading to the computer! And believe it or not those are supposed to be the cream of the crop from just over 3000 I actually took in total! I think I may have to preen a bit further!<br /><br />All that is left to say that it really has been an amazing adventure. I've met some great people, seen some magnificent sights and the food, well, what can I say..... I don't think anything  will taste as good ever again! <br /><br />Within myself I feel a change. I'm a little stronger, a lot wiser and I have a sense of confidence that I can do things on my own without 'adult supervision'! <br /><br />I will miss New York and hope one day to return. It really has been a remarkable experience. <br /><br />I'm hoping to leave this post with a photo of an image that will be etched in my mind forever. A beautiful ending to a wonderful holiday. The sunset on the statue of liberty from battery park.<br /><br />Bye Bye New York, missing you already! x<br />
