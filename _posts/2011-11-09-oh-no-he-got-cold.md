After our first late seeing a Broadway musical, I was still wide
awake this morning at 6:30!

It's now 8am here, I'm lying in bed and the lump way on the other side
just stirred and said. " I've got a cold!"

So I'm thinking I'm going to have a grumpy Patrick for the last few
days!!

Hopefully it won't stop me enjoying the sights.
Off downtown today, once he finally gets up!
