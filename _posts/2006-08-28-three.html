Bank Holiday Monday 2003.<br />Loughborough.<br />Me and Zara meet for the first time.<br /><br />Three years later and we're (hopefully) still as happy as the first time we met. Although I'm sure she'll tell you something a little more colourful.<br /><br />It's amazing the things you find on the internet.<br /><br />After my marriage broke down, up or whichever direction it goes in. I thought i'd never want to live with anybody else again. I was happy playing the field.<br /><br />And as with most fields, they have their good parts and their bad, some dry places, and some places crawling with strange little creatures. But in the field was also a beautiful flower that just attracted me from the moment I saw it.<br /><br />Unfortunately Zara stamped all over it and had stood in it's place by the time I got to it.<br /><br />Ok, ok, i'm joking. Yes, the flower was Zara. But that little paragraph was getting a little too Mills n Boony.<br /><br />As as someone who likes a whole lotta time to himself I think Zara deserves a medal for putting up with me for the past 3 years. Although I can say the same also ;)<br /><br />So how did we spend this most romantic of days?<br /><br />Buying a network card for the spare pc and struggling to get the miriad of cables under control behind the tv in an attempt to thwart small rodent teeth from reducing a very nice widescreen tv to a box full of bits.<br /><br />Oh, Zara did also get a nice new digital camera, so everything is getting photographed at 5.1 Megapixels and at 10x zoom.<br /><br />I got a coaster with a rat picture on it. But it keeps my computer table clean and looks nice. <br /><br />So I like it.<br /><br />Happy Anniversary honey.<br /><br />I love you.
