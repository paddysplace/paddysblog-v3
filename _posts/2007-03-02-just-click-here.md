Well we\'re surviving without Sky One so far. Zara was very brave and
deleted the channels from her [Digiguide](https://www.digiguide.com/)so
we don\'t get any reminders when I the shows we can no longer watch are
about to start.\
\
We\'re now getting into watching Heroes on SciFi channel instead.\
\
So now it\'s the weekend. Zara is at work, i\`m waiting for my bath to
run. So what do I do?\
\
Sign up to a new web services! Woo hoo!\
\
It\'s a disease, I swear it is.\
\
So my latest foray into the digital world is to have a
[tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)account.\
\
So what\'s tumblr. Other than a new Web 2.0 service that likes to leave
out the odd vowel. According to the blurb:\
\
[Tumblelogs are like blogs with less fuss. Tumblr is your friendly and
free tool for creating tumblelogs.]{style="font-style:italic;"}\
\
So there you go. Add this [link](https://paddysplace.tumblr.com/) to go
have a look. Add the rss feed and then wait weeks for me to post
anything new.\
\
Well I have a reputation to keep you know!
