https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/05/name-calling.html \-\-- I\`m a
piscetarian!\
And I had no idea.\
\
I\`m vegtarian. Well, half vegetarian as I still eat fish.\
Long story. So won\`t go into it now.\
But i\`ve never really been comfortable with saying i\`m vegetarian. And
then trying to explain why I still eat fish.\
\
Well according to various sources. I\`m a piscetarian. Or to get all
official like\
\
[pescetarian]{style="font-weight:bold;"} (PES.kuh.tayr.ee.un; PESH.uh-)
[n]{style="font-style:italic;"}. A person who supplements a vegetarian
diet with fish. ---[adj]{style="font-style:italic;"}. Also:
pescevegetarian, piscetarian.\
\
So now I can confuse people by telling them that instead now. As long as
I can remember the damn word.\
When it comes to remembering names i\`m as hopeless as someone who\`s
not very good at remembering names. Which is kind of ironic I guess as
isn\`t a lot of fish good for the brain?
