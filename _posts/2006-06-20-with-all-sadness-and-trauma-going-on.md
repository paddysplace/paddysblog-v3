\-\-- With all the sadness and trauma going on in the world at the
moment, it is worth reflecting on the death of a very important person,
which almost went unnoticed last week.\
\
Larry LaPrise, the man that wrote \"The Hokey Cokey\" died peacefully at
the age of 93. The most traumatic part for his family was getting him
into the coffin.\
\
They put his left leg in.\
\
And then the trouble started.\
\
\...laugh damnit people..it\'s only a joke.
