Oh thank God today is over with. I`m relaxing in the bath and I ache like buggery.<br /><br />There`s nothing worse than overlaying. It just throws me for the rest of the day. I feel like i`m playing catch up!<br /><br />Well not long after I posted my 'I`m late' message I went out to the van and the damn thing wouldn`t start. I wish i`d held off texting 'R' at work to say i`d overlaid until after i`d found the van was dead. Could have said i`d been trying to get it started.<br /><br />Ah well. <br /><br />Got into work 35 mins late. Well, when you`re already late why bother rushing. Then spent all day doing a job i`ve not had a lot of experience doing, hence the major acheyness.<br /><br />Still, wasn`t all bad. 'R' had a word with the boss. Told him none of us were happy about losing half a days pay before Christmas. And the boss relented! So I got a bit of extra money in my pay packet this week, wooo.<br /><br />So i`m gonna get out the bath before Zara bursts in here and starts measuring up again.<br /><br />The walls that is.<br /><br />For the tiles.<br /><br />When we do our new and improved bathroom.<br /><br />Ok. I`m done now.
