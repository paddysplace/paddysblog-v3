Yeah, it's Monday.<br />Yeah, my back still aches like mad.<br />And...yeah. I've had enough of work already.<br /><br />But, it's Ebay night!<br /><br />In about two and a half hours my 'Vintage' Lego item auctions will end. And my paypal account will be looking nice n healthy.<br /><br />Who says money can't buy you happiness?<br /><br />It's not gonna be enough to retire on, but it'll make Christmas very merry. I already sold my PS2 to make way for the Wii. And got a nice warm fuzzy feeling by accepting less than I wanted so a little boy would get what he wanted on his birthday.<br /><br />Aah. Yeah, she coulda been spinning me a tale, but. What the hell. It was my good deed for this year in the hope that our Wii will arrive before Christmas.<br /><br />Clocking up the overtime at work. Getting paid for my little job on the side, and selling on Ebay.<br /><br />Yep, money makes me pretty damn happy.
