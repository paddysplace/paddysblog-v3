Oh thank God today is over with. I\`m relaxing in the bath and I ache
like buggery.\
\
There\`s nothing worse than overlaying. It just throws me for the rest
of the day. I feel like i\`m playing catch up!\
\
Well not long after I posted my \'I\`m late\' message I went out to the
van and the damn thing wouldn\`t start. I wish i\`d held off texting
\'R\' at work to say i\`d overlaid until after i\`d found the van was
dead. Could have said i\`d been trying to get it started.\
\
Ah well.\
\
Got into work 35 mins late. Well, when you\`re already late why bother
rushing. Then spent all day doing a job i\`ve not had a lot of
experience doing, hence the major acheyness.\
\
Still, wasn\`t all bad. \'R\' had a word with the boss. Told him none of
us were happy about losing half a days pay before Christmas. And the
boss relented! So I got a bit of extra money in my pay packet this week,
wooo.\
\
So i\`m gonna get out the bath before Zara bursts in here and starts
measuring up again.\
\
The walls that is.\
\
For the tiles.\
\
When we do our new and improved bathroom.\
\
Ok. I\`m done now.
