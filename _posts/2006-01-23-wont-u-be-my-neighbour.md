\-\-- Ok, so I nicked a line from an Ugly Kid Joe song for my title.
It\`s hard thinking of new titles damnit!\
\
Anyway, introducing my new tenant Stacie from [Mommy\`s busy, take a
number](https://www.mommysbusytakeanumber.com/). I actually had quite a
few bidders to be my tenant this week. Maybe i\`m getting more popular,
heh.\
\
I think what really tipped it in her favour was the fact she has more
animals than us (and children, although we don\`t have any so not sure
if that counts!). Also her site is pretty much all pink which will piss
Zara off, which is another point in her favour, heh.\
\
Well my mind is a blank tonight. I\`m sure there was stuff I wanted to
say but I think it\`s gone and dribbled out my ears.\
\
Don\`t you just hate it when that happens.
