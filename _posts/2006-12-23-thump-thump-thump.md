Today has been a day of recovery.\
In both mind and body.\
\
Which sounds kinda cool and mystical and stuff.\
But in reality it just means I drank way too much on the works piss up
last night.\
\
Evil Smirnoff Ice.\
\
But I think my self is starting to forgive me for the 7 hours I made it
down copious amounts of vodka. Although the hour or so playing Wii
Sports this afternoon did cause a slight setback in the recovery
process.\
\
Anybody else reading this got their Wii\'s yet? no? Nobody wanna
exchange Wii addresses? No? Anybody still playing Animal Crossing? And
when I say anybody I mean you Carto? hmm? hmm?\
\
I think it\'s official. Me n Zara are complete Nintendo fanboys, er
girls, er people. You\'ve not lived if you haven\'t experienced Zara in
full flow playing boxing. It\'s a scary sight. I fear for my safety
now.\
\
So yeah. We\'re having fun. Christmas is going great so far. Life is
feeling good.\
\
I\'m a happy bunny.
