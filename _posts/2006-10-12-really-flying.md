where has this week gone!\
\
Can\'t believe it\'s Thursday all ready. My nice relaxing week is nearly
over.\
Sigh.\
Then back to the cruddy, boring normality of work.\
\
Haven\'t posted all week, which I know will not please some people. And
this one is going to be a bit short as i\'m pretty tired.\
\
Had a great day today. Me n Zara went flying with my dad.\
Video was taken, photo\'s were shot.\
\
I\'ll try n post a couple of the good ones.\
Had a go at the controls, and managed to keep us in the blue bit and
avoid hitting the green bit.\
\
Hence my ability to post here.\
\
Tomorrow should be fun as I have to try and control Zara and my mum in a
HobbyCraft center.\
\
I think flying the plane will turn out to be easier.
