I really didn\'t want to go to work today. I envied Zara being able to
spend time with them. I don\'t want to go to work at the best of times.
But I shall avoid ranting about how useless the management is. How much
work they make for us due to incompetence and the fact they actually
believe that because they are superior than us (in a workplace sense)
that they are beyond reproach despite them making more fuck ups in one
day than most of us manage in a lifetime of work.\
\
But I won\'t rant about that.\
\
Honest.\

Not today.\

Oh and can someone turn the heating down. This weather is way too hot
