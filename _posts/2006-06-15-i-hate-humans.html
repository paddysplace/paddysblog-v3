Excuse me folks whilst I have another I hate people moment. Yet again thanks to those Chink fuckers and their wonderful 'traditional medicine' bullshit.<br /><br />Taken from <a href="https://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx?oid=3">IFAW</a>'s website:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Saving Moon Bears from Lives of Torture -- China</span><br /><br />Asiatic black bears, commonly called “moon bears,” suffer terribly on Chinese “bear farms” where crude catheters are implanted in their stomachs to drain the bile from their gall bladders. The bile is used in Traditional Medicines (TM).<br /><br />IFAW is working to eliminate bear farming, provide humane treatment for bears currently imprisoned on “farms,” and to promote herbal alternatives to bear bile in TM.
