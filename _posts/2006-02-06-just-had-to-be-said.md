Now i\`m not one to be all political but I just had to post the picture.
Don\`t know if it was in any of the papers as I don\`t read them! But I
had to try not to laugh out loud at the irony of what this guy was
trying to say. Do you think he has ANY idea.\
\
Bearing in mind that this placard was waved in a country that allows
freedom of speech. I\`m sorry. But am I missing something here?\
\
Caricatures of their prophet is a no no.\
But burning caricatures of our leaders and calling for their deaths is
ok?\
\
Another story I caught over the weekend that had me shaking my head was
titled:\
[\
Dog owners in China opt to have canines\' vocal cords cut to keep them
quiet]{style="font-weight:bold;"}\
\
It\`s the shortest \'article\' i\`ve ever but the two lines that made up
the article left feeling there is not help for humanities stupidity.\
[\
In order to stop their pets from barking, many unlicensed owners in one
Chinese city are opting to have their dogs\' vocal cords
cut.]{style="font-style:italic;"}\
\
Hmm, I never will understand people.
