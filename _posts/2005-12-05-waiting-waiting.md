so how long do you think you should wait for an item you won on ebay to
be posted to you? (after paying of course!) 3 days? 5 days? 7 days? 10
days? how about 15 frickin days! and still no sign.\
\
I\`m being patient, well up until now anyway. Sent a 2nd email off to
ask the whereabouts of my item today and still waiting for a reply. I
also don\`t want negative feedback left if I get stroppy as this seller
is likely to do.\
\
I\`m tempted to put her email address in this post and get people to
pester her about it\....but I won\`t\...not yet anyway\...grrr.
