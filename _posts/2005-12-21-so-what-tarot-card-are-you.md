\-\-- ![The Tower
Card](https://images.quizilla.com/K/Koshari/1072669034_otTheTower.jpg)\
You are the Tower card. The Tower represents a\
sudden, drastic change. This change can be\
incredibly freeing. It can be a change in the\
way you think, or a change in environment. The\
physical body may be healed of a long illness\
in a seemingly miraculous way. Dramatic change\
may lead you into a completely different career\
or lifestyle. On the negative side of things,\
you may suddenly lose your fortune or have an\
experience that shatters your sense of\
identity. The Tower that crumbles under the\
lightning bolt is the physical and may be\
indicative of some aspect of your physical\
world. But as the Tower crumbles it reveals a\
sturdier foundation, something which perhaps\
you did not expect but which, nevertheless,\
arrives fully formed and strong into your life.\
