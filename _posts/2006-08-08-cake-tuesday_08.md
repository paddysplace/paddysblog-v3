Yes it\'s that time of the week again.\
\
Although I am getting kinda lazy and letting Zara pic which cake to put
up on a Tuesday. But with my terrible memory that\'s kind of a good
thing as i\'d probably keep rotating the same half dozen cakes over n
over.\
\
Anyway, here\'s Shaggy and Scooby which she did for a friends\' lads
birthday. I think. Although I may be wrong on that.\
\
Be comforted in the knowledge that all you get is the cake picture and
don\'t have to put up with my dodgy impression of Shaggy\...\
