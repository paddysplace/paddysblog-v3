Ok, too knackered to post anything meaningful so did a quiz to find out which sc-fi character i`d be....<br /><br />Qui-Gon Jinn<br /><br />A strong presence who organizes efforts yet shuns consensus, you strive to educate others for the benefit of your causes.<br /><br />Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration on the here and now where it belongs. <br /><p><a href="http://www.tk421.net/character/"><img src="http://www.tk421.net/character/quigon.jpg" style="border-color: rgb(248, 248, 255);" alt="Which Fantasy/SciFi Character Are You?" border="2" height="250" width="257" /></a></p><br /><br />Ok, that`ll do for now. This Jedi Master needs some food and a bath!
