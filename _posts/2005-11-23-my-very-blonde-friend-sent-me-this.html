A girl came skipping home from school one day.<br />"Mummy, Mummy," she yelled, "we were counting today, and all the other<br />kids<br />could only count to 4, but I counted to 10.<br />See? 1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8,9,10!"<br />"Very good," said her mother.<br />"Is it because I'm blonde, Mummy?"<br />"Yes, it's because you're blonde," her mother replied.<br />The next day, the girl came skipping home from school.<br />"Mummy, Mummy," she yelled, "we were saying the alphabet today, and all<br />the<br />other kids could only say it to D, but I said it to G.<br />See? A, B, C, D, E, F, G!"<br />"Very good," said her mother.<br />"Is it because I'm blonde, Mummy?"<br />"Yes, pumpkin, it's because you're blonde."<br />The next day the girl came skipping home from school.<br />"Mummy, Mummy," she yelled, "we were in gym class today, and when we<br />showered, all the other girls had flat chests, but I have these!"<br />And she lifted her tank top to reveal a pair of 36Cs.<br />"Very good," said her embarrassed mother.<br />"Is it because I'm blonde, Mummy?"<br />"No ... it's because you're 25."
