Well as it was my dads birthday at the weekend it makes this weeks cake
an easy choice.\
\
The one passion in my dads life is flying. Anything to do with planes
really. He has his pilots license and regularly takes to the skies. Or
at least spends most of his waking hours at the airfield.\
\
My mum suggested a Red Arrows theme this year. And with a couple of
suggestions of my own to give Zara even more headaches; this is the
result.\
