Birthday Zara\
\
Sorry I\'m not the type to wine you n dine you, I\'m just no good at
that sort of thing. Although I am hopefully going to make something with
pasta later tonight.\
\
And we have a ton of chocolate to melt on the chocolate fountain. So at
least we can make ourselves violently sick; even if we can\'t watch
Battlestar Galactica on our new LCD tv. Damn modern technology. You
think they\'d make em last more than a day!\
\
So my day off work, and Zara\'s 25th has been a day of ups n downs.
