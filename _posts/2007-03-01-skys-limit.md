thank you Branson and Murdoch. I guess having billions of pounds
doesn\'t mean you\'re gonna be less of a dickhead.\
\
In the war between content providers the casualties are the customers. I
knew it was gonna happen. But I switched the tv on this morning hoping
that Sky One was still gonna be there.\
\
But no.\
\
So fuck you Sky. I\'m not gonna be the donkey that you dangle the carrot
infront of and follow you mindlessly to become a Sky customer. I\'ll
take my chances with Virgin and see what they can offer without the
crutch that is Sky.\
\
I\'ll miss watching new episodes of Lost, Battlestar Galactica, Bones
and others. But my life will go on without them. Even if it means
waiting until later in the year to watch them I somehow think i\'ll
live.
