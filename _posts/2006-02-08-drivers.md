https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/02/drivers.html \-\-- Drivers! No
not the pesky things you need to download to get certain hardware
working! I\`ve had enough of them!\
\
I mean the idiots who get behind the wheel. I swear they were all after
me today. Had to make a delivery today out of town. Not a long journey.
It gets me out of work for an hour or so, so I don\`t mind.\
\
But, was it national looney overtaking day today? If I had one near head
on collision I must have had about five by the end of the journey.\
\
I\`m not saying i\`m the best driver in the world. But I know when to
overtake and when to stay behind the articulated lorry thats barreling
along infront of me.\
\
Still. What do I know. I think tomorrows Thursday Thirteen is going to
be 13 things that piss me off.\
\
What really did it for me was the sticker in some guys car that read
\'smoke free zone\'. I know modern cars have catalytic converters. And I
know he meant no smoking in his car. But honestly. Smug little twats
like that piss me off. I bet he was an ex-smoker as well.\
\
Ok, it\`s been a long day and i\`m kinda tired and grouchy. Can you
tell?\
\
Still, cold have been worse. Zara\`s brother in law got a nasty surprise
when someone plowed into the back of his car yesterday. One of those
muppets in a damn big 4x4 with bullhorns on the front of it made out of
railways tracks, or something. Why do people need those things just to
go shopping at tesco?\
\
Right, i\`m done now. Less than half an hour to stargate atlantis is on.
Time to relax!
