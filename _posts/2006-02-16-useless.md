https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/02/useless.html \-\-- Thats how I
feel right now. I can\`t explain why really. It\`s just something in me
feels that whatever I do isn\`t good enough. Or the right thing to do.\
\
It\`s probably best I just stay out of everybody\`s way. I hate times
like this. I don\`t feel like i\`m in control of anything.\
\
I\`m just tired I guess. Low.\
\
I should be used to criticism or the comments. Maybe I just let the
words hurt me too much.
