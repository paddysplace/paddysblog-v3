\-\-- Bloody typical. First day of my hols and i\`m wide awake! Been
wide awake since 6am!\
\
Still feeling seriously festive though. Even though technically it\`s
the weekend, so wouldn\`t be going to work anyway. Ah well.\
\
So I was laying in bed thinking I should do my own little review of the
year. Couldn\`t really think of anything much so, as I won\`t see any of
them until next year thought I would rant about the people I work with!\
\
Ok, then I thought, hmm what if any of the read this. So decided, what
if I could condence it down to one word to say how I feel about them. So
here goes.\
\
This will probably be the most boring blog entry i\`ve made this year.
But it\`s early, i\`m awake, so you can suffer too :)\
\
CW: Supercilious\
SW: Immature\
LT: Bossy\
LB: Nice\
RJ: Cool\
PW: Arrogant\
SC: Sarcastic\
AT: Apathetic\
AA: Assuming\
\
That\`s about it really. The rest I don\`t really care about one way or
the other.\
\
Well that killed off a few minutes. Time to take to Neverwinter Nights.\
\
Lets go kill some orc!
