Never thought i'd say it, but finally the weekend is over.<br />It was 2 days of taking the wrong route on any decision.<br />If i'd gone to work on Saturday I wouldn't have wrecked my back helping with the pets.<br />If i'd gone and had my bath straight aways and not helped Zara in the kitchen we wouldn't have argued when we did and have a night feeling miserable.<br /><br />Amazing, and quite scary how one little change in direction can set the whole of your day in a different light.<br /><br />Wow, well there's my deep n meaningful moment out the way for today.<br /><br />I've done my good deed for the day. A fly landed in my bathwater, so I fished it out and now it's sat next to me drying.<br /><br />I really am a soft sod.<br /><br />I might put the hair dryer on it in a while to help it out.<br /><br />Damnit.<br /><br />So I had a 'i hate my job' kinda day today. Which probably isn't helping my mood any, along with my back.<br /><br />I need a break. Christmas is starting to take way too long to get here now. I've had enough of this year.<br /><br />I need it to be in 5 weeks time, right now. 18th December. Happy Birthday brother. You would be. Should be 34. I start to get anxious, although really it's just another day.<br /><br />But it's not.<br /><br />Ok, I really don't know where i'm going with this train of thought. My head is all jumbled up.<br /><br />So i'll leave it there.
