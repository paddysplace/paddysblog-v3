Damn you Deanna and your 'if you grew up in the 70s' email.<br /><br />I've gone all dreamy of the days I grew up in a small village in the middle of nowhere next to the river.<br /><br />Getting snowed in every winter and the school bus not getting through.<br /><br />Only 3 tv channels, and still racing home on my bike on Saturday to watch the A Team, or the Hulk or the Dukes of Hazzard (which is being shown on Bravo and still is damn good to watch).<br /><br />And despite only the 3 channels I had more tv to watch than I do with my 30+ channels; <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie's Angels, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers In The 25th Century, The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea, Knight Rider, The A-Team, Kung Fu, CHiPs, The Fall Guy, Street Hawk, Logan's Run and The Man From Atlantis</span> to name a few!<br /><br />Going out to play with friends first thing in the morning and not coming home until tea was ready at 5pm. And actually having to walk or ride a bike to get anywhere.<br /><br />Action Man was a real hero, and not some gimp with a snowboard like he is now. Losing the skin on my knuckles winding up the power wheel to release Evil Knievel on his motorbike. <br /><br />Queuing up outside to watch Star Wars at the local cinema. And the film shown before the 'main feature' was about bikers/hells angels. And I decided then that I wanted a motorbike.<br /><br />Never actually getting the hang of skateboarding. Despite having a cool book with lots of pictures showing you how to 'hang 5'<br /><br />Buying '<a href="https://www.lookinarchive.com/homepage.html">Look In</a>' for all the cool posters of bands like Boomtown Rats, Adam and his ants & Blondie.<br /><br />Not even knowing what a computer was!<br /><br />Being able to buy sweets for half a pence.<br /><br />Saying flippng heck was classed as swearing.<br /><br />I guess everybody feels like this about the decade they grew up in. Mine seems to span between 1976 and 1986 when I left school. <br /><br />Everybody's years are the best to them.
