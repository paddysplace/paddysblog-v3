Drivers! No not the pesky things you need to download to get certain hardware working! I`ve had enough of them!<br /><br />I mean the idiots who get behind the wheel. I swear they were all after me today. Had to make a delivery today out of town. Not a long journey. It gets me out of work for an hour or so, so I don`t mind.<br /><br />But, was it national looney overtaking day today? If I had one near head on collision I must have had about five by the end of the journey.<br /><br />I`m not saying i`m the best driver in the world. But I know when to overtake and when to stay behind the articulated lorry thats barreling along infront of me.<br /><br />Still. What do I know. I think tomorrows Thursday Thirteen is going to be 13 things that piss me off.<br /><br />What really did it for me was the sticker in some guys car that read 'smoke free zone'. I know modern cars have catalytic converters. And I know he meant no smoking in his car. But honestly. Smug little twats like that piss me off. I bet he was an ex-smoker as well.<br /><br />Ok, it`s been a long day and i`m kinda tired and grouchy. Can you tell?<br /><br />Still, cold have been worse. Zara`s brother in law got a nasty surprise when someone plowed into the back of his car yesterday. One of those muppets in a damn big 4x4 with bullhorns on the front of it made out of railways tracks, or something. Why do people need those things just to go shopping at tesco?<br /><br />Right, i`m done now. Less than half an hour to stargate atlantis is on. Time to relax!
