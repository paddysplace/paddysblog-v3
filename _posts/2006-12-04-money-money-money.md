Yeah, it\'s Monday.\
Yeah, my back still aches like mad.\
And\...yeah. I\'ve had enough of work already.\
\
But, it\'s Ebay night!\
\
In about two and a half hours my \'Vintage\' Lego item auctions will
end. And my paypal account will be looking nice n healthy.\
\
Who says money can\'t buy you happiness?\
\
It\'s not gonna be enough to retire on, but it\'ll make Christmas very
merry. I already sold my PS2 to make way for the Wii. And got a nice
warm fuzzy feeling by accepting less than I wanted so a little boy would
get what he wanted on his birthday.\
\
Aah. Yeah, she coulda been spinning me a tale, but. What the hell. It
was my good deed for this year in the hope that our Wii will arrive
before Christmas.\
\
Clocking up the overtime at work. Getting paid for my little job on the
side, and selling on Ebay.\
\
Yep, money makes me pretty damn happy.
