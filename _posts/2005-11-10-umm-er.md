https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2005/11/umm-er.html \-\-- I\`ve
decided. I\`m going senile. There\`s this music hour on the radio. Top
10 at 10. It plays the top 10 of a given year and you have to guess that
year. Plays pretty much all 80\`s stuff. So there\`s me and Rob, both in
our mid 30\`s. Prime 80\`s music listening candidates. And pretty much
for the whole hour all you can hear is us going.\
\"Ooh, yeah, I know this\"\
\"Yeah, me too\...ooh, on the tip of my tongue\"\
\"Hmm, yeah, lead singer is, oh what\'s his name\"\
\"I know it. I know I know it\"\
\
Pretty sad really. Unless it\`s something blindingly obvious and I still
listen to it now then my brain is beginning to let me down.\
\
Also doesn\`t help that we work with a 17 year old who must look at us
and think \'what a couple of old fogies!\'\
\
But I decided a while ago not to care. I intend to grow old
disgracefully. My girlfriend often wonders if i\`ll be the only 80 year
old with a lip ring. I still listen to rock in all its forms. Still love
sci-fi/fantasy altho refuse to go to conventions. And don\`t think i\`ll
ever have a respectable haircut!\
\
Maybe that\`s what will keep me young. I see other\`s around me of the
same age and they all just seem so old. Some even seemed old when we
were 16. Maybe it\`s in my genes. My gran still seems young despite
suffering with illness. And my mum is more active than me!\
\
Been listening to Marillion and Pink Floyd all day on my Ipod so I think
i\`m in a bit of a nostalgic mood. If there\`s one album that sums up my
youth then it\`s Pink Floyd\`s \'The Wall\'. Hands down the best album
ever. Got round to buying it on cd after losing my cassette version a
while ago. With the one song that\`s brought me to tears so many times,
Comfortably Numb, I can listen to all 26 tracks now without wanting to
self harm. Still brings up the same feelings I had when I was a
teenager, but the anger has gone.\
\
Damn, want to play it again now!
