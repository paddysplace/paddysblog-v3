...the weather that is. Not me.<br /><br />Well actually and me. I`m getting a cold. A man cold obviously. Which as we all know means it`ll be something akin to malaria. <br /><br />It`s only small at the minute. But I can feel it growing in my head. Slight sore throat, starting to get a headache and bunged up nose. Zara has taken over my mum`s role of stuffing vitamins down me and buying Lucozade. Which i am out of as I drank a full bottle yesterday.<br /><br />So here I sit in my dressing gown and wooly hat (no i`m not going to take a picture!) drinking hot chocolate and eating Nice biscuits.<br /><br />So before I forget i`ll give a shoutout to my newest tenant. The very lovely Stephanie at her <a href="http://www.mystickalincense.com/blog/">Mystickal Incense & More</a> blog. Go check it out for the cool stuff she makes and cool things she says. Oh and she has cute pics too.<br /><br />And speaking of cute things. Mikey, our lone male guinea pig has found a friend. We have mice living in the walls of our shed where we house the guinea pigs during winter. Well I guess one mouse has been disowned by the other or Mikey is better company `cos the last couple of days Zara has gone to put them out in their runs to find Mikey cosying up to this little fella...all together now.....<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/DSCF0635.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/DSCF0635.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/DSCF0639.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/DSCF0639.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
