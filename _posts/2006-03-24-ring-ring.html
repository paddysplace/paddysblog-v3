Another geeky moment. I know. I`m a sad case really.<br /><br />Got a lovely phone call from T-Mobile saying i`m eligible for an upgrade. And as my Nokia 6610i is in a bad way.<br /><br />Damn those cheap Chinese covers.<br /><br />Well. It didn`t take much convinving on the part of the salesperson that what I need is a new phone.<br /><br />So now i`m going to be awake all night with excitement waiting for it to be delivered tomorrow.<br /><br />Like I said. I`m a sad case.<br /><br />It`s been a long week at work so it`s nice to look forward to something. That`s my excuse anyway.<br /><br />The boss it back next week. Oh happy happy joy joy. We worked with the factory costings a bit more and it turns out we`re not quite up shit creak yet. It`s still a bit worrying though. Looks like my one man leading department (consisting of yours truly) is the only one making any money when it comes to double glazed units.<br /><br />Yay me!<br /><br />To be honest if he ditched a couple of the slackers in there then things would improve no end. I`m starting to lose the inclination to really care. Why should I? nobody else seems to.<br /><br />I don`t want to be like that. I ended up hating the last place I worked. Doing the same kind of work!<br /><br />Well it`s Friday. So no more thinking of work until 8am Monday.
