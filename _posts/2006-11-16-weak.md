\-\-- I\'m ok now. I always feel ok with the world when i\'m safe in my
own home. With the curtains closed and the doors locked on these cold
nights.\
\
But out in the real world I don\'t often feel in control.\
\
I\'m weak willed\
Weak minded.\
Weak spirited.\
\
An animal has probably died because of me, and I hate myself for it.\
\
We have a rat at work, or rats. Or something that\'s chewing the cables
and eating the left over food we discard.\
\
I suggested a humane trap.\
I just didn\'t hammer the point home that this was the right thing to
do.\
\
I was weak.\
\
Pest control was brought in.\
Poison was put down.\
Now there is no sign of the little furry critter.\
\
I had been putting bits of crisps down in my work room. And by morning
these had been eaten.\
\
So now the little guy is gone. And it\'s all down to me.\
\
Our workplace had bought mousetraps. Mousetraps for fuck sake!\
It\'ll maim it I said.\
Nobody listened.\
So I made sure I was the last to leave, and then made sure the traps
didn\'t do any kind of damage.\
\
So then the poison was put down.\
And I did nothing.\
I felt like I could do nothing.\
I might as well have put the poison down myself.\
\
I\'m sorry to the little fella who had the misfortune to think our
workplace was a safe refuge from the cold world.\
\
But I guess at least he ate well whilst he stayed in my work room.\
\
I\'m just weak.
