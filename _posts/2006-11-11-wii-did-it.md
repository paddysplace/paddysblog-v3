https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/11/wii-did-it.html \-\-- The end
of another funny day.\
\
A day of fun, laughter, arguing and stony silence.\
\
Life would be so boring if it was any other way.\
\
Finally gotten round to pre-ordering our Wii.\
\
Now it\'s just the long wait until 8th December, and then hope we\'re in
the first batch to be sent out.\
\
I\'m no good at waiting.
