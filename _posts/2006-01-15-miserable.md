weather that is. Not me.\
\
Well actually and me. I\`m getting a cold. A man cold obviously. Which
as we all know means it\`ll be something akin to malaria.\
\
It\`s only small at the minute. But I can feel it growing in my head.
Slight sore throat, starting to get a headache and bunged up nose. Zara
has taken over my mum\`s role of stuffing vitamins down me and buying
Lucozade. Which i am out of as I drank a full bottle yesterday.\
\
So here I sit in my dressing gown and wooly hat (no i\`m not going to
take a picture!) drinking hot chocolate and eating Nice biscuits.\
\
So before I forget i\`ll give a shoutout to my newest tenant. The very
lovely Stephanie at her [Mystickal Incense &
More](https://www.mystickalincense.com/blog/) blog. Go check it out for
the cool stuff she makes and cool things she says. Oh and she has cute
pics too.\
\
And speaking of cute things. Mikey, our lone male guinea pig has found a
friend. We have mice living in the walls of our shed where we house the
guinea pigs during winter. Well I guess one mouse has been disowned by
the other or Mikey is better company \`cos the last couple of days Zara
has gone to put them out in their runs to find Mikey cosying up to this
little fella\...all together now\.....\
