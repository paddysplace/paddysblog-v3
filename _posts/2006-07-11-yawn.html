30 mins to post my thoughts before my laptop battery dies.<br /><br />Unfortunately my brain is running low on power as well.<br />Hence the infrequent posting of ramblings about myself.<br />Maybe i'm just tired of 'thinking' too much. It gets tiring constantly complaining about work.<br />I don't lead the most exciting of lives.<br />And my deep and inner most thoughts seem to want to keep buried.<br /><br />Maybe i'm just feeling burnt out blogging.<br />Already!<br />I know others get this way. <br /><br />I wonder how many people still read my posts.<br />The lack of comments suggest not many.<br />I'm probably having an attention deficit moment.<br />I know Kitty still waits for Cake Tuesday :)<br />On it's way soon.<br /><br />Maybe this is like writers block. I sit and think I MUST post someting...but what.<br />But then there are times when I do have stuff to post and just can't be arsed to do it!<br /><br />Oh woe is me!<br /><br />Well, none of this is probably making any sense to anybody.<br />I'm just grabbing thoughts as typing them out as they enter my brain.<br /><br />Maybe I just need a bath.<br />I tend to post better when i'm in the bath.<br /><br />And no, that doesn't mean I haven't had a bath for a while!
