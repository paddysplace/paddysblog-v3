Sigh. Any Linux experts reading this know how to get a Geforce MX/MX400 to play nicely with Mandriva?<br /><br />Not had the best tech day. I even loaded up Skype to be greeted with my first voicemail message....for someone else!...arggh!<br /><br />I`m tired.<br />I`m getting a cold<br />Things don`t want to work for me.<br /><br />All this makes for a grumpy Paddy.<br /><br />So now all you nice people leave me lots of lovely comments, voicemail messages and chat messages and i`ll try and cheer up a bit.<br /><br />Hmmm, who says i`m a comment whore ;)<br /><br />Oh and whilst you`re at it. Anybody fancy buying the domain name nlgw.com. My boss has it plastered on the side of one of our work vans but hasn`t actually bought the domain name!<br /><br />I would gladly pay for someone to do it (just so it doesn`t get traced back to me!) just to see the look on his face. Oh, and it`ll save me having to do the website for him.<br /><br />See, grumpy and vindictive.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0131Image0136.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0131Image0136.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Maybe I should go take it out on the bathroom walls. Zara took a piccy of me all ready for some demolishing action! Scary huh!
