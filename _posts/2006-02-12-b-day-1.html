The crew are here...ie, Zara`s mum and Rod. We`ve let them have our bedroom as the only guest room we have is the computer with <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/1600/2006_0131Image0082.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7081/1699/320/2006_0131Image0082.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>a small folding out bed/settee. It also means i`m closer to my computer ;)<br /><br />So here I sit on the edge of my 'bed' with a rat sat up my dressing gown sleeve. I`m beginning to think the animals are the ones with the most sense. They don`t fill their lives with the stresses us humans do.<br /><br />More to the point, they don`t feel the need to redecorate their living area/toilet area. Ok, so i`m getting a little stressed about the impending bathroom refit. This is seriously unknown territory for me and part of me is regretting starting it.<br /><br />I know it`ll be alright in the end. But it`s that feeling of standing on the edge of a cliff and looking down and getting that sinking feeling that it`s going to really really hurt.<br /><br />I`m just going to go with the flow. Whatever Rod says is the right thing to do I`m gonna go with. Cos I don`t have a clue. And anyway, Zara will probably be doing enough disagreeing for the both of us.<br /><br />To pick a line from my favourite film to sum up how I feel right now. I`ll have to rely on Star Wars ;)<br /><br />"Help me Obi Wan you`re my only hope"
