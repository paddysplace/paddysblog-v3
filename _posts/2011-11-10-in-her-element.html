<div><p>My feet hurt. My feet have gone passed the point of hurting. We've walked round Manhattan Island today I think. </p><p>We went down to the WTC memorial which I found very hard to be near. Felt very emotional for some reason. Walked along the edge of the river and through wall street. Managed to avoid joining the 'occupy wall street' protest. Stayed in Battery Park looking out over the Hudson River towards the Statue of Liberty whilst the sun set. Another emotional moment for both of us this time.</p><p>So a bit of retail therapy was called for, and after a bit of walking around Times Square we found the M&amp;M and Hershey's stores. Zara was in chocolate heaven. </p><br/><img src='http://lh3.ggpht.com/-FL9CW3PvETw/TrvHYuoheDI/AAAAAAAACT8/RCESr5UJQdQ/IMAG0608.png' /><br/><img src='http://lh3.ggpht.com/-1N77h6CuN7Q/TrvHachiftI/AAAAAAAACUA/RimL1xp6koE/IMAG0607.png' /></div>
