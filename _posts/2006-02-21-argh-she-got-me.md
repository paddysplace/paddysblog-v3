i\`ve been tagged by the very wonderful
[Tarragon](https://www.hazeltree.net/). So here are the rules:\
\
[List seven songs you are into right now. No matter what the genre,
whether they have words, or even if they're any good, but they must be
songs you're really enjoying now. Post these instructions in your blog
along with your seven songs. Then tag seven other people to see what
they're listening to.]{style="font-style:italic;"}\
\
My songs of the moment are:\
1. Wango Tango - Ted Nugent\
2. Symphony of Destruction - Megadeth\
3. Downbound Train - Bruce Springsteen\
4. Ends - Everlast\
5. The Thin Ice - Pink Floyd\
6. Broken Heroes - Saxon\
7. Electric Head - White Zombie\
\
I only have 4 peeps to sacrifice to this meme, so if anybody feels like
doing it then let me know it my comments, k?\
