Ah, any excuse to use a Stevie Nicks song as a title.<br />Well, i`ll probably stick this button somewhere on the right hand side of my blog where i`ll get lost amongst the rest of the crap I have down there.<br /><br />But until then it`ll sit here.<br />And probably end up being in every post I write until someone sends me an audio message damnit.<br /><br />Well here it is.<br />It`s not scary.<br />It doesn`t cost you anything.<br />So go record me a message.<br /><br /><a href="https://odeo.com/sendmeamessage/Paddee"><img alt="Send Me A Message" border="0" height="83" src="https://odeo.com/img/badge-send-me-button-blue.gif" width="209" /></a><br /><br />Oh, you do need a microphone tho.
