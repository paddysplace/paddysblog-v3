The lack of posts the last couple of days can be put down to one thing.<br /><br />Nintendo DS.<br /><br />In a fit of spending fury I threw caution to the wind and credit card to amazon.co.uk and ordered a lovely white Nintendo DS Lite....in white.<br /><br />For a bargain price of £109 with a copy of Dr thingumyjig's Brain Training I couldn't put if off any longer. And after 2 days brain training i`ve gone from having the brain of a 72 year old to that of a 33 year old. I'll let Zara comment on her progress...hehe.<br /><br />So is it any good? Well after about an hour showing it off to my parents they were straight onto amazon to order one for themselves. Family get togethers are going to get a lot more interesting.<br /><br />But now I have a headache. I think i've stretched my mental capacity too far. Which doesn't take too long. By the end of the week my brain should be that of a new born baby. So i'll be dribbling and cooing by the weekend.<br /><br />Which is pretty much how I end up after a few too many.
