i\`m wondering if i\`m normal.\
\
Maybe it\`s a stereotypical comment to make about women taking long
soaks in the bath. But is it normal for a man to like taking long
baths.\
\
No bubbles tho!\
and no Kenny G on low in the background!\
\
Ok, so I have candles. But that\`s only because i\`m too lazy to change
the lightbulb. I am in here with a glass of Jack Daniels and I am
playing on my laptop, so that has to be at least a couple of man points
in my favour.
