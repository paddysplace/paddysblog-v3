If if wasn\'t for the presence a of large Ginger head in one of these
pictures it may be hard to believe that these pictures were taken only
yesterday. Yes we have a new visitor. I\'ve named him Junior for the
remarkable resemblance he has to the ginger cat we already have in our
household. Not just looks but mannerisms and paw size too!\
\
We discovered him last night in the garden when we were putting the pigs
to bed, so we guess he\'s a new resident to one of the surrounding
houses. Of course not missing a chance for photo opportunity I went out
armed with a camera, much to the worry of senior who was watching from
the kitchen window wondering weather he was to be replaced! I did feel
guilty knowing he was watching, but you forget what energy they have and
how fun they are to be around at that age, that I just couldn\'t help
myself!

If some photos are a little blurry it was getting quite dark at this
point and it was a job keeping up with him!
