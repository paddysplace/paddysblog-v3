hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn\'t
seem\
to be breathing and his eyes are glazed.\
\
The other guy takes out his phone and calls the emergency services.\
\
He gasps: \"My friend is dead! What can I do?\"\
\
The operator says: \"Calm down, I can help. First, let\'s make sure
he\'s\
dead.\"\
\
There is a silence, then a gunshot is heard.\
\
Back on the phone, the guy says: \"OK, now what?\"\

\
A woman gets on a bus with her baby.\
\
The bus driver says: \"That\'s the ugliest baby that I\'ve ever seen.
Ugh!\"\
\
The woman goes to the rear of the bus and sits down, fuming.\
\
She says to a man next to her: \"The driver just insulted me!\"\
\
The man says: \"You go right up there and tell him off - go ahead, I\'ll
hold\
your monkey for you.\"\

\
A man and a friend are playing golf one day at their local golf course.\
\
One of the guys is about to chip onto the green when he sees a long
funeral\
procession on the road next to the course.\
\
He stops in mid-swing, takes off his golf cap, closes his eyes, and
bows\
down in prayer.\
\
His friend says: \"Wow, that is the most thoughtful and touching thing I
have\
ever seen. You truly are a kind man.\"\
\
The man then replies: \"Yeah, well we were married 35 years.\"
