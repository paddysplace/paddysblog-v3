\-\-- Ok, first things first before I forget.\
\
Go say hi to Gina, my new tenant. She has a very colouful blog. And
manages to come out with many words of wisdom and things I could never
think of saying.\
\
I hope that sentence made sense. I\'m sat here with a headache. Not in
the bath for a change but sprawled out on the settee. This post would
have been made from the bath, but my router keeps having a hissy fit and
decides not to let any outgoing connections to the internet. Or to any
of my other pc\'s for that matter.\
\
Anyway, enough of the geekyness. I\'m controlling the overwhelming urge
I have right now to record programmes off the tv. Doesn\'t matter what
it is. But it just needs to be recorded.\
\
Our dvd/hdd recorder arrived today\...yay. And it is good. Up to 200
hours of God knows what will be clogging up the hard drive in no time.
So the new series\'s of Stargate and Battlestar Galactica had better
hurry the hell up and start soon!
