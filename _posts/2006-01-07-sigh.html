Well Christmas is well and truly over for another year. It`s my last weekend of the holidays. <br /><br />The tree is down and shoved back in the loft. <br />The tinsel has been removed from everything it was able to be draped round<br />The cards are piled up ready to be recycled.<br /><br />I hate this part of Christmas. Now it`s just a cold, miserable time of year.<br /><br />Although we do still have a fair bit of food and drink to get through. It`s always the same. Always end up buying twice as much as is humanly possible to get through in 2 weeks....maybe we should freeze it until next year!<br /><br />Well onto happier things. My Frappr map is starting to fill up. Well when I say fill up I mean there`s more than just me n gemmak on there!...thanks to Kitty and my girlfriend (finally!) And my first non UK frappr gabrielle from Indonesia. Wooo, i`ve gone international!
