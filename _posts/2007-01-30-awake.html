It's 5am and i'm wide awake.<br />For some reason my brain is dumping images and memories of my brothers first crash.<br />He'd just woken up from intensive care.<br />It's not like it is in the movies.<br />People just don't wake up and start talking to you like they've woken up from a long sleep. Well maybe sometimes they do.<br />He didn't even recognise me. Couldn't speak.<br />It was one of the worst days of my life.<br /><br />When was all this?<br />I really can't remember the exact date. Which might sound odd. But my brain is hopeless at retaining some information.<br />Zara sometimes thinks i'm lying to her about certain facts when they tend to change depending on how my brain relates to them.<br /><br />t still no words<br />It was more like an animal looking at you. Looking towards where the sound was coming from.<br />I smile<br />He smiles.<br />But nothing else.<br />My stomach just knots up then.<br />He doesn't recognise me.<br />He has no idea who I am.<br />Or Tina.<br />Bruising to the brain affected his speech.<br />But the rest....it's not like it is in the movies.<br />The nurse soon came in to explain everything.<br />She had wanted to warn us what we could expect before we went in.<br />But I guess I was just too impatient to see my brother.<br /><br />So what's my brain doing?<br />It's not an anniversary of the event.<br />Certain times bring me crashing right down and I'm in my own little dark cloud for what seems like days sometimes.<br /><br />Well i've got 2 hours before I have to get ready for work.<br /><br />Time to try and sleep again. See what things my stupid brain brings forth for me to mull over.
