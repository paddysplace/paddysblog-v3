Yes. I'm guilty. I've been playing elsewhere and have been spending less and less time with you.<br />It's not you.<br />Well maybe partly it is.<br />There's less complications with this other one.<br />Nicer looks too.<br />But don't take it personally. I'll keep with you until the bitter end.<br />I still have feelings for you and that's what matters.<br />This new one is just..well...different.<br /><br />Of course i'm talking about blogs here. And by blog I mean my new fave obsession, and by obsession I mean <a href="https://paddysplace.tumblr.com/">here.</a><br /><br />My private, or not so private thoughts, cake tuesday and the like will still be posted here. But the other crap I find on the internet will be over on my tumblr site. As well as the other dozen sites i'm addicted to at the minute.<br /><br />I'll try not to let this blog fall into disrepair.<br />Maybe I just need to spread my wings a bit.<br />Try a change of scenery.<br /><br />That sort of thing.
