https://paddeesplace.blogspot.com/2006/07/moving-on.html \-\-- It seems
weird not having our little rat leading his little ratty life in the
house. You got used to hearing him moving his bedding about. Clinking
his food bowls as he tried to get them closer to his bed. The little
snuffles and wheezes he made.\
\
I guess if you\`re not a pet person. Or a rat person in particular none
of this makes much sense. But they get under your skin. Then just as you
get used to them being there; they\`re gone.\
\
We buried him in the garden yesterday. Which to be honest I find is the
hardest part. I think it\`s makes it final. Zara has been cleaning his
house out today. Which looks horribly bare now.\
\
So now we have to move on. Not forget. Or to get over. But to get on
with our lives. And when we feel ready the house will again be filled
with the noise of bedding being moved, food bowls clinking and snuffles
and wheezes.\

I was going through the videos on my phone, finally giving them all
meaningful names when I cam across a couple of Sooty. This is one from
about 2 weeks ago. Just before he started going downhill.
