\-\-- Ok, i\`m all set for Christmas. All the presents have been bought
and have arrived. Done ALL my shopping online this year. It\`s been
building up and up as the years have gone by until this year I hit the
100% mark. Well, actually it\`s probably 99% as I really need to get
some chocolate type presents for my girlfriend.\
\
Life will NOT be worth living if I don\`t!\
\
The food is in.\
The booze is in.\
The Radio Times has been read through in detail and all programs/films I
want to watch have been highlighted.\
The wrapping paper has been bought.\
\
I\`m good to go. Christmas can start now!\
\
Last day at work tommorrow. Work until 12 then off to the pub.\
\
I\`m not a day drinker so will probably last about an hour. I\`m trying
to figure out how to go drinking with my workmates and go to Tesco for
chocolately delights at the same time.\
\
I haven\`t formulated a plan yet!\
\
I\`m hoping for a Christmas bonus as I don\`t really feel like pissing
my own money up the wall.\
\
Then after that I can sit infront of the tv with my box of biscuits for
cheese, alcoholic beverage and tv guide and go into semi-hibernation.
