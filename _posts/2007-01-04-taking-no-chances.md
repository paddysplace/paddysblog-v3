days in and I need another break from work already. My morning starts
at:\
\
7:10am Zara\'s Alarm goes off\
\
7:15am My radio alarm goes off\
\
7:20am My mobile phone alarm goes off\
\
7:25am My mobile phone alarm goes off\
\
7:30am My mobile phone alarm goes off\
\
Ok, i\`m getting out of fuckin bed.\
\
7:55am Go to work\
\
12:30pm Wake up\
\
What happens between the hours of 8am and my dinner at 12:30 is a
mystery. But i\'m sure I must be working as I haven\'t been sacked yet.
