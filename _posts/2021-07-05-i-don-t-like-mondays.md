It's that feeling of "here we go again" We're at the top of the rollercoaster. Just bracing for the sudden stomach-churning descent. Which is great if you like the exhilaration of the ride. I've always hated rollercoasters. Never been on one. Never wanted to. Never will. Rollercoasters are like life. I never asked to be on the damn thing. But here I am, going through the same stomach-churning experience. Round and round. Up and down. Feeling sicker and sicker as time goes by.

I want to get off. But I'm stuck on this damn thing because everybody I love is here with me. Going through various feelings of exhilaration and nausea of their own. And feeling like, "well, they're here with me so I'd better stay on the ride"

I do sometimes enjoy it. When it's going slow, at the bottom where it feels like it's virtually stopped. The calm before the storm.

So yeah. I don't like Mondays. Or rollercoasters.
