Well i`m not actually. I`m laid here in the bath with Zara doing DIY!<br /><br />And I mean DIY in the bathroom renovation kind of way. <br /><br />This is going to be the most perfect bathroom ever. Or at least it would be if Zara wasn`t saying 'oh, i`m not happy with that'' -out come the -whatever is needed to put it right- and she`s off again.<br /><br />As long as the bath water is hot and the neighbours can`t see me then i`ll be happy with this bathroom,<br /><br />Ok, the cats are here now. Garfield wants the sink tap on so he can have a drink.<br /><br />Sigh, it must be nice to relax in the peace and quiet after a hard days work. I shouldn`t complain too much. Zara is working damned hard on this bathroom. So i`m not. Complaining that is.<br /><br />And whilst I remember I shall introduce my newest tenant <a href="https://stumblingthroughlifewithgrace.com/index.php">3rd Times a Charm</a> who has promised to be a model tenant and not leave pizza boxes everywhere.
