Bit of a title eh!\
Well, it\`s not so wank now. But that\`s how I felt earlier on. And all
thanks to three little letters.\

I\`m getting past the point of hating DIY to near violent tendancies.\
I wasn\`t really in the mood today. But I guess that\`s what Bank
Holiday\`s are for.\
Still finishing off the last fiddly job in the bathroom. Nothing major.
Just a bit of trim around the bath to tidy it up a bit.\
\
But, God, i\`ll be pleased when it\`s done. It\`s partly my own fault as
I do my best to put off doing it. That and just the thought of it gives
me a headache.\
\
I also introduced Zara to the joys of Cleethorpes.\
Which killed off a couple of hours yesterday.\

Beaches were walked along, ice-cream was eaten and crazy golf was
played. Perfect day.\

Mainly cos I won at crazy golf. Woo Hoo!
